13892106530	Associated Press	Officials work to unravel how and why gunman carried out deadly attack on NYC office building	NEW YORK (AP) - Investigators are piecing together more details about how a former high school football player who blamed the game for his mental\n\nhealth problems carried out a deadly attack on an office building that is home to the NFL.\n\n Shane Tamura killed four people on Monday before killing himself, spraying the skyscraper's lobby with bullets and then continuing his rampage on the 33rd floor, authorities said.\n\n Inside his wallet, a handwritten note claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy , known at CTE, and accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of brain injuries linked to contact sports, investigators said.\n\n Detectives were still working to unravel more details about the 27-year-old's background and motivations.\n\n They planned to question a man who supplied gun parts for the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack, including the weapon's lower receiver, Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a video statement.\n\n Among the dead were a police officer, a security guard and two people who worked at companies in the building. An NFL employee was badly wounded but survived.\n\n Tamura, a Las Vegas casino security worker, had intended to target the NFL's headquarters in the building but took the wrong elevator, officials said.\n\n It's unclear whether he showed symptoms of CTE, which can be diagnosed only by examining a brain after death.\n\n Tamura, who played high school football in California a decade ago but never played in the NFL, had a history of mental illness, police said without giving details. In the three-page note found on his body, he accused the NFL of concealing the dangers to players' brains for profit. The degenerative brain disease has been linked to concussions and other repeated head trauma common in contact sports such as football.\n\n At a Tuesday night vigil for those killed in the shooting, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and other faith leaders delivered prayers at a park about a dozen blocks from where the shooting took place.\n\n Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke of the need for stronger gun laws.\n\n "We cannot respond to senseless gun laws through vigils," Adams said.\n\n NFL boss calls shooting 'unspeakable'\n\n Tamura's note repeatedly said he was sorry and asked that his brain be studied for CTE.\n\n The NFL long denied the link between football and CTE, but it acknowledged the connection in 2016 testimony before Congress and has paid more than $1.4 billion to retired players to settle concussion-related claims.\n\n NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , who works out of the offices, called the shooting "an unspeakable act of violence."\n\n The shooting happened at a skyscraper on Park Avenue, one of the nation's most recognized streets, just blocks from Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. It is less than a 15-minute walk from where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed last December by a man who prosecutors say was angry over what he saw as corporate greed.\n\n Video shows the gunman stroll into the building\n\n Tamura drove across the country in the days before the attack and into New York City, Tisch said. Surveillance video showed him exit his BMW outside the building at about 6:30 p.m. Monday wearing a button-down shirt and jacket with the rifle at his side.\n\n Once inside the lobby, he opened fire and killed Islam and Wesley LePatner, a real estate executive at the investment firm Blackstone, which occupies much of the building. Tamura then made his way toward the elevator bank, shooting the NFL employee and an unarmed security guard, Aland Etienne, who helped control access to the upper floors.\n\n Tamura waited for the next elevator to arrive in the lobby, let a woman walk safely out of the elevator, then rode it up to the 33rd-floor offices of the company that owns the building, Rudin Management. He killed a worker for that company before killing himself, officials said.\n\n Friends and family mourn killed officer\n\n Officer Didarul Islam, 36, who was guarding the building on a paid security job when he was killed, had served as a police officer in New York City for over three years. He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and was working a department-approved building security job when he was shot.\n\n Islam leaves a pregnant wife and two children. Friends and family stopped by their Bronx home on Tuesday to drop off food and pay their respects.\n\n "He was a very friendly guy and a hardworking guy," said Tanjim Talukdar, who knew him best from Friday prayers. "Whenever I see him or he sees me, he says, 'How are you, my brother?'"\n\n ___\n\n Collins reported from Hartford, Connecticut, and Seewer from Toledo, Ohio.

13892026515	Associated Press	Asian shares are mostly higher after China-US talks end without a trade deal	BANGKOK (AP) - Shares in Asia were mostly higher on Wednesday after the U.S. and China ended their latest round of trade talks without a deal.\n\nU.S, futures edged higher while oil prices slipped.\n\n Beijing's top trade official said China and the United States agreed during two days of talks in Stockholm, Sweden, to work on extending an Aug. 12 deadline for imposing higher tariffs on each other. The U.S. side said an extension was discussed, but not decided on.\n\n U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says the American team would head back to Washington and "talk to the president about whether that's something that he wants to do."\n\n A Friday deadline is looming for many of Trump's proposed tariffs on other countries. Several highly anticipated economic reports are also on the way, including the latest monthly update on the job market.\n\n "Markets had been floating on a cloud of trade optimism - first Japan, then the EU - but the sugar high is wearing off. Now, with U.S.-China talks dragging on in Stockholm, there's a growing sense that the momentum is stalling," Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\n Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.3% to 25,441.64 while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5% to 3,628.53.\n\n Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged less than 0.1% higher to 40,687.17. Gains for electronics companies were offset by losses for major exporters like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.\n\n Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 8,759.20 and in South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,259.00.\n\n Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.9% while the Sensex in India edged 0.1% higher.\n\n On Tuesday, U.S. stock indexes edged back from their record levels as a busy week for Wall Street picked up momentum. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 6,370.86, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 44,632.99.\n\n The Nasdaq composite was down 0.4% at 21,098.29.\n\n SoFi Technologies jumped 7.4%, but Merck dropped 2.2% and UPS sank 9.2% following a torrent of profit reports from big U.S. companies. They're among the hundreds of companies telling investors this week how much they made during the spring, including nearly a third of the stocks in the S&P 500 index.\n\n UnitedHealth Group dropped 5.8% after reporting a profit for the spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. It also gave a forecast for profit over all of 2025 that investors found disappointing. The health care giant said it expected to earn at least $16 per share, when analysts were looking for something close to $20, according to FactSet.\n\n Shares of Novo Nordisk that trade in the United States tumbled 21.3% after the Danish company cut its forecast for sales growth this year, in part because of lower expectations for its Wegovy weight-loss drug amid high competition.\n\n Treasury yields sank as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rates.\n\n Despite pressure from President Donald Trump for lower rates, which would give the economy a boost, the widespread expectation is that the Fed will wait for more data about how Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation and the economy before making its next move.\n\n The U.S. economy appears to be slowing.\n\n One report on Tuesday said that U.S. employers were advertising fewer job openings at the end of June than a month before, though still more than economists expected. A separate report said confidence rose among U.S. consumers , but a measure of their expectations about the near term remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead.\n\n In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 7 cents to $69.28 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, was up 13 cents at $71.82 per barrel.\n\n The dollar fell to 148.13 Japanese yen from 148.48 yen. The euro rose to $1.1554 from $1.1546.\n\n ___\n\n AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.\n\n	IRRELEVANT

13894573904	New York Times	An Office Tower Shooting Shocks New York; New York Today	The city's strict gun laws could not prevent someone driving across the country with an assault rifle.\n\nGood morning. It's Wednesday. We'll get details about the shootings in a Midtown Manhattan office building by a 27-year-old man with an assault rifle. We'll also go for a ride along the route of an old freight line that is expected to get new life as a passenger rail line.\n\nOn Sunday, Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stood in front of tables full of guns that the police had confiscated, a sampling of the thousands of illegal firearms they said had been taken off the streets. The fight against gun violence would continue, the mayor said, until "we stop the sea of violence that we are experiencing in our city."\n\nThen, on Monday, a man carrying an assault rifle brazenly walked into an office building in Midtown Manhattan and opened fire - even though New York has some of the nation's toughest gun laws, even though the office building that the assailant targeted had more security than many others have and even though similar targeted violence in Manhattan is almost unheard of.\n\nThe safeguards were not enough to stop the gunman, Shane Devon Tamura, 27. He bought his AR-15-style rifle in Nevada, where it was legal, and drove to New York, where it was not. The police said four people were killed, among them an off-duty New York City police officer who was moonlighting, providing security. A fifth person was wounded.\n\n"We have to ask ourselves: Is there a safe building anywhere if we are allowing AR-15s to be sold in so many states?" Nick Suplina, a senior vice president of the Manhattan-based advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told me. "Unfortunately we're only as safe as the state with the weakest gun laws" - which, he added, Nevada was not. On his way to New York, Tamura drove through several states, including Colorado and New Jersey, where assault weapons have been banned, and others where they are legal.\n\nNew York has posted near-record-low incidents of shootings lately, as the mayor said on Sunday: Last year was the fourth-lowest on record for shootings, and the first six months of 2025 tied with the same period in 2018 for the fewest shooting incidents on record.\n\nBut as cellphone photographs circulated from inside rooms where office workers had barricaded themselves behind couches stacked against doors, the rampage on Monday kindled fears in an already-edgy city. "We do not have to live this way," said Kris Brown, the president of Brady, another gun control advocacy group. "No one should have to hide in a bathroom at work in fear of getting shot."\n\nOfficials, too, were frustrated. "People are tired of thoughts and prayers," said Gov. Kathy Hochul, voicing frustration that assault weapons are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. "We closed dangerous loopholes" in New York, she said, urging Congress to "summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban."\n\nLaw enforcement agencies were trying to piece together what motivated Tamura. So were friends, neighbors and teammates from his middle-class childhood in California and his more troubled adult life in Nevada. Like the attack on a UnitedHealth executive on the sidewalk outside a Manhattan hotel last year, the rampage appeared targeted: One tenant in the building, at 345 Park Avenue, was the National Football League. Tamura, who had played football in high school, left a note urging authorities to scan him for C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma that can only be diagnosed after death.\n\nThe is-any-building-safe question was one that people who spend their days in the office towers of Manhattan asked themselves as they went to work on Tuesday. As my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out, the tragedy raised new concerns about security in New York and the role that businesses should play in the national conversation about gun control, mental health and safety.\n\nAs for security, badges and sign-in lists for visitors became standard fare in New York office buildings after the Sept. 11 attacks nearly a quarter-century ago. Many buildings installed turnstiles between guard desks and building elevators. In recent months, some buildings had stepped up their precautions even more because of the war in Gaza.\n\nWall Street firms did so again in the wake of the carnage on Monday. Interfor International, a security consulting firm whose clients include private equity firms and hedge funds, said that most of its clients would have armed security guards for the rest of the week. Some employees wondered about the guard who smiled every day as they walked by on their way to turnstiles leading to elevators. Was that guard now wearing a bullet-resistant vest? Had he or she been wearing one before?\n\nPerhaps more troublingly, Tamura apparently managed to defeat safeguards in the building he stormed into. It had a system to stop the elevators that might have kept Tamura from reaching the 33rd floor, where he killed his final victim before pointing the gun at his own chest and pulling the trigger one last time. The mayor said that the person who could have shut down the elevators was a guard in the lobby - one of Tamura's first victims.\n\nExpect a sunny day with a high near 96 degrees. It will be mostly cloudy tonight, with a low near 78. There is a chance of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon and overnight.\n\nIn effect until Sunday (Tisha B'Av).\n\nThe latest New York news\n\n•Too close to schools: Dozens of licensed cannabis dispensaries were allowed to open too close to schools because of a misreading of the law. In all, more than 100 shops may have to move.\n\n•Seeking Sean Combs's release on bail: Lawyers for the music mogul, who is scheduled to be sentenced in October on his prostitution conviction, asked that he be released on a $50 million bond.\n\n•Fighting over redistricting: Gov. Kathy Hochul said that New York would consider redrawing its congressional maps if Texas followed President Trump's call to redraw its own map to favor Republicans. Hochul's move comes as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois are also discussing possible redistricting actions.\n\n•Sesame Street's New York: When the children's show premiered on PBS, its set was designed as an idealized version of one of New York's inner-city streets. Over more than 50 years on television, the show has evolved to reflect the changes of the city it was made to mimic.\n\n•Where eel is on the menu: Several restaurants in New York have put the snakelike fish, which often carries a reputation for difficulty, into the culinary spotlight. Find out where you can try a dish starring what one chef called an "incredible ingredient."\n\nWhere a future train line will take you\n\nIt's just a video of a train ride. But it's unexpectedly captivating.\n\nIt was made by three of my colleagues and a videographer, who hopped a freight train to see where New York City's future train line would go. As train lines are concerned, this one is not ready for prime time: Right now, there's a lot of graffiti along the way, and junk on the edges of the tracks in some places.\n\nBut it's not hard to imagine what officials see in what is being called the Interborough Express, or the IBX: a connection between Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nRight now, the 14-mile route carries freight trains that handle lumber, beer and other cargo. Officials envision 19 stops, tying together stretches of the city that have never had many transit options. About 160,000 weekday riders are expected to use the IBX, according to Jamie Torres-Springer, the head of construction and development at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is leading the project.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, a major supporter of the IBX, has already approved $2.75 billion for the project, about half its cost. In a statement, she called the IBX a "no-brainer" with the potential to shorten some commutes by 35 percent. The fare would be the same as a subway ride. But the IBX would run with light-rail cars, skinnier and smaller than the ones on the subway system.\n\nDrummer girl\n\nDear Diary:\n\nThere she was, the drummer girl\n\nBeating down a heater on Bleecker Street\n\nGlaring into oblivion\n\nWith a look of indifference\n\nI felt shy - I felt fearless\n\nI approached - I confessed\n\nSaw your show last night\n\nYou guys were legit\n\nDrummer Girl took a drag\n\nExhaled and said\n\nThe ensemble pitched in\n\nBut those were my songs\n\nThat was my show\n\nDid you see that crowd?\n\nI owned them\n\nI dropped them in their tracks\n\nBefore I could answer\n\nShe flicked the cig upward\n\nInto a sky of low-hanging stars\n\nAnd before that cig hit the asphalt\n\nShe was gone, leaving me to wonder\n\nWhy I liked her as much as I did\n\n- Danny Klecko\n\nIllustrated by Agnes Lee.

13894574015	Dow Jones	Markets A.M.: Can the Mag Seven Play Moneyball?	Sponsored by\n\nCan the Mag Seven Play Moneyball? By Spencer Jakab\n\nIt's an unusual Fed day: The real tension was last week when President Trump toured the central bank's headquarters and backed down from firing Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank won't cut today , but a highly unusual degree of dissent is possible as voters angle to be Powell's successor. Futures point to a flat open for U.S. stocks after they broke their winning streak Tuesday .\n\n***\n\n"A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars."\n\nSo runs the iconic line from "The Social Network." There's an echo of that in Mark Zuckerberg's AI recruiting pitches , where he's making $100 million salary offers to some AI hires-more than some entire Major League Baseball rosters.\n\nWill the right talent help Meta hit it out of the park? How about an extra $30 billion in software and equipment just this year? That's the increase in the Facebook parent's forecast capital expenditures compared with what analysts thought it would spend when ChatGPT was released two-and-a-half years ago, according to FactSet.\n\nIt seems like every big company is investing in artificial intelligence. But Meta, along with fellow "hyperscalers" Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet are in a league of their own.\n\nBetween them, analysts' average forecasts of their capital expenditures for this fiscal year have doubled since late 2022 to a whopping $317 billion. That's equivalent to 1% of U.S. economic output.\n\nIt's hard to be the first one to blink in an arms race. This week will give three of those four a chance to test the waters and see how investors react.\n\nAlphabet certainly didn't hedge its bets : The company released second-quarter results last week and said it would up its planned capital spending-a lot of which is AI-related-this year by another $10 billion to $85 billion.\n\nAll this makes for an unusual earnings-season dynamic. The hyperscalers, along with other members of the Magnificent Seven, have provided the lion's share of U.S. stock-market gains over the past few years, even as they spend with abandon.\n\nIn the long run, any stock's value comes from free cash flow-money it earns but doesn't spend. If it invests that cash instead and creates an above-market return then that's even better. Shareholders' money compounds for a bigger future payout.\n\nWill it, though? That's the literal trillion-dollar question.\n\nIt was just six months ago that news of Chinese AI model DeepSeek's impressive performance , supposedly done cheaply, rattled U.S. tech stocks . The S&P 500 shed that much market value in one day; chip-maker Nvidia fell 17%.\n\nWe don't know if it's possible for so many companies to spend so much on a developing technology and all make great returns. Is any researcher worth twice as much as slugger Juan Soto ?\n\nOf course it depends on the goal. If it's a winner-take-all race to be the first to "superintelligence," then maybe. If it's an exercise in grinding out profits by spending wisely, in the spirit of Michael Lewis's influential tale "Moneyball," the hyperscalers risk getting less bang for shareholders' bucks.\n\nEarnings season is no longer just about earnings for these tech behemoths.\n\nI need more coffee\n\nStarbucks announced on Aug. 13, 2024 that it would hire Chipotle's Brian Niccol as CEO, adding more than $20 billion to its market value.

That came after the Food and Drug Administration allowed Sarepta to resume shipments of its gene-therapy drug, Elevidys.\n\nStarbucks : Shares in the coffee chain gained 4% premarket, despite earnings undershooting estimates. Starbucks said it was investing more than $500 million in staffing and abandoning pickup-only stores as part of its response to a sales slump.\n\nVisa : The credit-card company posted forecast-beating results for last quarter, citing resilient consumer spending .

13894573995	Bloomberg	Humana Raises Guidance on Growth in Medicare Advantage	(Bloomberg) -- Humana Inc. raised its profit guidance for the year on Wednesday, bucking a trend in the US health insurance industry after most other companies cut their forecasts in recent months.\n\nThe company's shares rose 4.5% in premarket trading in New York.\n\nManagement said medical costs were in line with expectations - which hasn't been the case for many of the company's rivals lately - and that it benefitted from growth in its Medicare Advantage and pharmacy businesses. \n\nThe company raised its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to around $17 per share, up from the previous guidance of about $16.25 per share. For the second quarter, Humana's adjusted profit of $6.27 per share handily beat Wall Street expectations of $5.74 a share.\n\nHumana's increased guidance and profit beat are a welcome bit of good news for the health insurance industry, which has seen higher-than-anticipated medical costs over the past year, causing several companies to withdraw or lower their financial outlooks in recent months. Insurers in general have said that medical costs are increasing and government policy changes are squeezing their bottom lines.\n\nHumana gets most of its revenue from selling Medicare Advantage plans, private versions of Medicare for the elderly in the US. Costs have been rising in that business for years across the industry as Americans seek out more medical care. \n\nOn Wednesday, Humana said its stemming declines in its Medicare Advantage enrollment by doing a better job of selling plans. The insurer changed its guidance to now anticipate a decline of "up to 500,000" members in Medicare Advantage, from prior expectations for "approximately 550,000." Management said it "remains confident" in its pricing strategy in Medicare Advantage this year.\n\nHumana appears to be handling challenges in the Medicare Advantage business better than most, as it works to increase the profitability of its individual Medicare Advantage plans. \n\nBy contrast, the largest Medicare Advantage insurer, UnitedHealth Group Inc., has struggled. On Tuesday, UnitedHealth said its annual profit would be lower than Wall Street analysts were expecting. The health conglomerate had cut and later withdrew its financial guidance earlier this year because of higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage costs.\n\nHumana's mail-order pharmacy also brought in more money than expected because it filled more prescriptions. Some of these were weight-loss drugs filled through telehealth companies and other programs to help patients get drugs, like Ro, WeightWatchers, LifeMD, and Novo Nordisk A/S's NovoCare.\n\nHumana's medical cost ratio was 89.9%, in line with the around 90% that the company had previously forecast. That measure shows how much premium revenue the company spent on medical care. \n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n	RELEVANT

Monarez has been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January, and previously worked as the head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. She was viewed as somewhat surprising pick for the CDC role because unlike most recent CDC directors, she holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor. ...

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency is not asking to restrict natural products made from kratom, which contains trace amount of the compound. In a report released Tuesday, the agency said it maintains concerns about kratom broadly but needed to act urgently on 7-OH because of its risk of sedation, nausea, breathing problems and addiction. "We think it's night and day in terms of the public health risk," Makary said of 7-OH products.

If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government's most powerful way to control the country's planet-warming pollution and fight climate change. The repeal was based in part on a hastily produced report - authored by five researchers who have spent years sowing doubt in the scientific consensus around climate change - that questions the severity of the impacts of climate change. (Nllsen and Freedman,\n\n Scientific American: Hurricane Forecasters Keep Crucial Satellite Data Online after Threatened Cuts\n\n Satellite data that are useful for weather forecasting-and particularly crucial to monitoring hurricanes-will not be cut off by the Department of Defense at the end of the month as originally planned. The data, which provide an x-ray-like view of a hurricane's internal structure, will remain accessible to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the satellites' lifespans, a NOAA spokesperson confirmed in an e-mail to Scientific American. These data are particularly useful for monitoring storms at night, when visible satellite imagery is unavailable, and for catching rapid intensification-when a storm's winds jump by at least 35 miles per hour in 24 hours. The faster forecasters note a storm is quickly ramping up in intensity, the faster they can warn people in harm's way.

(Eastabrook, 7/29)\n\n Bloomberg: Novo Nordisk Picks Insider As CEO After Selloff From Wegovy Slump\n\n Novo Nordisk A/S named its head of international operations as chief executive officer after slumping weight-loss drug sales led to a profit warning that wiped $93 billion off its market value. The Danish drugmaker promoted Maziar Mike Doustdar, who has spent more than three decades with the company, to the top spot. The surprise choice disappointed investors who were hoping for a high-profile outsider to lead a fresh challenge to Eli Lilly & Co., which has been pulling ahead of Novo in the obesity market. (Kresge, 7/29)\n\n Bloomberg: UnitedHealth Slumps As New Outlook Disappoints Yet Again\n\n UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s bad year is getting even worse. The health-care conglomerate offered fresh profit guidance that was far below its early projections and below all analyst expectations. Executives also declined to explicitly affirm a long-term growth outlook that the company has pointed investors to for years, a sign that its challenges aren't going away any time soon. The key problem facing UnitedHealth is it didn't anticipate Americans would use medical care at the rate they did when setting premiums last year. (Tozzi, 7/29)\n\n The Baltimore Sun: UnitedHealthcare, Johns Hopkins Medicine At Odds Over Health Insurance Contract\n\n Doctors at Johns Hopkins Medicine hospitals and facilities could stop accepting insurance from national health insurance provider UnitedHealthcare in about a month if an agreement to maintain the health plan is not reached.

"There are a couple of categories that we currently compete in where we might be interested in acquisitions if they offer an opportunity to significantly improve the growth rate and margin structure," P&G Chief Executive Officer Jon Moeller told analysts during an earnings call on Tuesday. (Neumann, 7/29)\n\n Modern Healthcare: J-1 Visa Restrictions Push Phoenix Children's To Recruit Earlier\n\n Health systems expect recruiting overseas clinicians and technicians to take longer and cost more over the next year as the federal government restricts immigration. President Donald Trump's administration temporarily paused visa processing, increased visa information requests and banned travel from certain countries. These changes are expected to further bog down an already backlogged system, potentially reduce access to care and inflate administrative costs, hospital executives, lawyers and policy experts said.

"What an opportunity for small-town America to have a doctor be able to practice in a model like this and have more expanded opportunities," Davenport said at an event sponsored by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

The White House and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to announce the commitments on Wednesday, Ruth reported last week. The agency hopes the commitments will stoke companies to make it easier for patients to import their data into an app of their choice, where they can manage their day-to-day health and easily share their history with doctors.

Nearly half of hospitals surveyed failed to identify "harm events" among hospitalized Medicare patients in October 2018, according to the Health and Human Services Department Office of Inspector General. Even fewer of those occurrences were investigated, the OIG found.

Botox, made by Allergen, and the cancer drug Keytruda from drugmaker Merck are made in Ireland. (In recent years, however, more of Keytruda's manufacturing has shifted to the United States.) In the short term, drug companies might increase the list prices of these products to account for the higher cost, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. "U.S. consumers will pay more at the pharmacy counter for these drugs," Conti said. "What patients pay at the pharmacy counter reflects drug companies' set price list." (Lovelace Jr., 7/29)\n\n CNN: 'Ozempic Face' May Be Driving A Cosmetic Surgery Boom\n\n About two years ago, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank noticed a new type of patient arriving at his New York practice. Amid an explosion in the number of Americans losing weight with drugs like Ozempic, he saw a "dramatic spike" in clients experiencing unwelcome side effects.

After years of living with debilitating hip and knee pain, the 66-year-old needed extra assistance to get around. Though she retired from her office manager job four years ago and moved to Colorado from Kansas, Thompson was still working two jobs - at a consignment clothing store and handling bookkeeping at a Sprouts Farmers Market - for extra income.

On Tuesday, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter said that Mr. Tamura had been the subject of multiple calls related to mental health logged by the Las Vegas police. He was held involuntarily for 72 hours after mental health crises at least twice, once in 2022 and again last year, according to two other law enforcement officials, one of whom said the holds had occurred in Nevada. He had been charged with criminal trespass and received traffic citations in Nevada, records show.

The man's brother, Shane Gille, said he yelled at law enforcement officers who arrived at his Pellston home on Sunday to tell him his brother was in custody. "I laid into them," Gille told Bridge Michigan. "We've been throwing flags for the last 28 years that he needs a kind of placement." "Things need to change," he continued, adding that his family offers "condolences to the families and the victims that have had to endure this. This is a completely tragic incident that was completely preventable."

In a new conference Tuesday in Columbia, South Carolina, Carr's parents said they wanted to bring awareness to the rare but often fatal brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri organism. The infection, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM, occurs when water is forced up the nose and is able to cross into the brain, which can happen during recreational freshwater activities.

13900639454	Forbes (US)	How Local Targeting Can Help Marketers In Stormy Economic Conditions	Rob Davis, President and CMO at Novus Media.\n\nAt my company, we have a saying: Geography is destiny-in life and business. People of similar economic, demographic and cultural backgrounds tend to live near each other. And when people join communities and become part of something larger, it tends to influence how they feel and think and what resonates with them. Geography becomes particularly important during economic duress. For companies-and their agencies-this means you must work hard to find potential buyers without overspending on data and impressions that don't convert.\n\nGuideline, among other industry watchers, is predicting modest advertising spend increases, but at a slower rate than 2024 due to economic concerns. Therefore, there will be increased pressure to make those dollars count. So, what is the best way for companies to find the in-market buyers? Meeting them where they live, work and play alongside other similar people.\n\nI recommend using the humble ZIP code to leverage geolocation for targeted advertising. This goes beyond advertising and doesn't just affect pure-play retailers. From insurance to technology providers, if you have a target audience, you have several ZIP codes that will likely perform better than others. I believe geographic data should always be a core component of every business's strategy, but especially so when times are tough because it's often the best way to drive buyers to make a purchase. Here are some reasons why:\n\nYou can supercharge prioritization.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people who live together to develop bonds and speak the same dialect. If the town or city is known for certain industries, people who live next door to each other are probably more closely aligned in salary and worldview than they might be to someone in a similar job in another state. That's just the reality.\n\nModern organizations develop one or a few ideal customer profiles (ICPs) with descriptors that identify the most likely or most lucrative customers. Oftentimes, you can find many people in these ICPs in the same area. You can then look at patterns in the data to identify the best prospects and opportunities for prioritization.\n\nFor example, we had an enterprise software client that wanted to target the largest companies in the U.S. We identified 16 cities that housed high percentages of those ideal customers and digitally skewed our impressions in those cities while still running a national campaign. Those cities included the obvious-New York, Chicago and the Research Triangle in North Carolina-but also Minneapolis (which features Target, United Health and General Mills), Dallas (which includes AT&T and American Airlines) and St. Louis (which includes Anheuser-Busch, Centene and Edward Jones).\n\nAs another example, a spirits client of ours wanted to reach casual non-beer drinkers who like to socialize in small groups. We were able to find and heavy up areas with the highest concentration of these groups.\n\nYou can save on data costs while improving targeting.\n\nMany marketers too often think of targeting in pure psychographic or non-location-based demographic data, attributing half of their media spend to data and targeting costs instead of exploring potentially better or cheaper options. It's important to remember that not every localization strategy is alike. Advertisers that instead prioritize third-party audience data, which can add significant costs on a cost-per-mile basis, may struggle to maximize their value. Not only is the oft-forgotten ZIP code typically free in most digital media buying platforms, it's also more likely to drive purchase decisions in many scenarios.\n\nSo, why doesn't everyone use ZIP codes for targeting? First of all, a ZIP code alone won't tell you much. You also need the historic data to unlock pertinent insights. Second, setting up a ZIP code strategy can take more effort. But once you get the mechanics down, in my experience, it's pure value.\n\nYou can advertise nationally, but tailor locally.\n\nResearch from Locality and The Harris Poll, published in AdAge (paywall), found more than 50% of individuals are more likely to purchase from a brand advertising locally compared to 13% nationally, highlighting the importance of a robust local strategy. Local advertising also gives companies the opportunity to frame messaging in terms that most resonate with that audience.\n\nFor example, while planning a retail client's national buy, we tailored ads for different products to different neighborhoods (e.g., nasal spray to areas with high pollen counts or beauty products to neighborhoods that tended to have high concentrations of young women interested in low-cost makeup). We saw immediate gains.\n\nAdvertisers that use local targeting can either affect national sales by targeting those areas most likely to buy or drive deeper local sales by tailoring messaging and placements to those most swayed by local advertising.\n\nIn closing, audience targeting can be a powerful tool for marketers to reach buyers and prospects with improved precision. Whether you are conducting a national campaign or just advertising locally, the power of matching the right message to the densest market makes a ton of sense. Remember the common refrain: think global, act local, especially when it comes to advertising.\n\n	IRRELEVANT

13900650380	Forbes (US)	InnovationRx: Trump's EU Tariff Deal Will Add $13 Billion To Drug Costs	In this week's edition of InnovationRx, we look at the impact of Trump's tariffs on drugs made in Europe, Halle Berry's menopause startup, Ambience Healthcare's $243 million fundraise, and more. To get it in your inbox, .\n\nEli Lilly's plant in Kinsale, Ireland\n\nBloomberg Finance\n\nFor months, there have been questions about what the impact of Trump's tariffs on drugs would be. On Sunday, we got part of the answer: Under the trade deal reached between the U.S. and the European Union, medicines imported from Europe will face a 15% tariff.\n\nThat tax hike will hit some of the biggest blockbuster drugs, including Keytruda (for cancer) and Wegovy (for obesity), as well as less well-known brand name medications. Questions remain about generics: European Commission President von der Leyen said on Sunday that certain generics would be exempt, but the White House fact sheet on the deal lists no such exceptions.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the cost of the tariff will likely be passed to American consumers, both directly and indirectly through higher insurance premiums. ING analyst Diedrick Stadig told Forbes that once stockpiled medicines are gone, the tax would add around $13 billion to the cost of imported drugs.\n\nThere will be indirect costs, too. As companies look to manage the impact of Trump's tariffs by building out U.S. manufacturing, they could potentially cut spending in other areas, including research and development, to compensate, Emarketer analyst Rajiv Leventhal told Forbes. "They're going to have to cut back in other areas to not have Wall Street panic," he said.\n\nHalle Berry's Menopause Act\n\nHalle Berry\n\nCliff Watts for Forbes\n\nIn May 2024, Halle Berry, the actress and former model, shouted three words on Capitol Hill to a bipartisan group of senators (all women): "I'm in menopause!"\n\nBerry, now 58, first became focused on the issue, as both an entrepreneur and an advocate, after her own perimenopause was misdiagnosed as herpes. She originally founded Respin as a wellness and exercise website in 2020, but relaunched it this February as a menopause-focused healthcare company.\n\nWith less than $5 million in funding from investors including Khosla Ventures, Respin is still in its earliest days. Telehealth visits just launched in July and revenue is mostly nonexistent. But Berry's work, profiled in Forbes as part of this year's 50 Over 50 list, is just one indication, along with VC-backed Midi Health, which has raised more than $100 million, that menopause is finally getting some attention.\n\n"This is my greatest act," Berry tells Forbes. "And I couldn't have imagined that this would be my greatest act because I think as women, we've been afraid to age."\n\nRead more here.\n\nBIOTECH AND PHARMA\n\nSarepta Therapeutics is again shipping its gene therapy Elevidys for patients with Duchene muscular dystrophy (a particularly severe form of the disease) who are able to walk. The latest move came after the FDA recommended the removal of a voluntary hold it had previously placed on the drug. The face-off between Sarepta and the FDA followed the deaths of three people from Elevidys or a similar drug (that's in early-stage clinical trials) from liver failure. Duchenne patients and their families had put pressure on the FDA to reverse the decision, though the agency said it will continue to investigate the deaths.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Vinay Prasad, the FDA's top vaccine and gene therapy official, abruptly resigned after just three months after he took the job. Prasad, head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, had faced heavy criticism from the right over his handling of Sarepta, including an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal's editorial board and derision from pro-Trump influencer Laura Loomer. The Health and Human Services Department has not yet said who will fill his role.\n\nDIGITAL HEALTH AND AI\n\nOpen AI-backed startup Ambience Healthcare raised $243 million - one of the year's largest VC investments in healthtech - led by Oak HC/FT and Andreessen Horowitz. The new funding increases Ambience's valuation to more than $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. Founders Michael Ng, the company's CEO, and Nikhil Buduma, its chief scientist, previously founded digital health startup Remedy Health.\n\nPlus: Sword Health, the $4 billion (valuation) digital health startup, launched a new AI division to help payers and providers increase operational efficiency.\n\nMEDTECH\n\nImagine getting a heart valve replacement and being able to resume your normal, daily activities a week later. That's the reality for four patients at the Cleveland Clinic, according to case studies it presented earlier this year. Its surgeons were able to use robots to perform the aortic valve replacement surgery through the patients' necks, avoiding the need for open-heart surgery and its accompanying long, painful recovery. One patient even reported he'd resumed running in the gym a week after he was discharged.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH AND HOSPITALS\n\nMillions of undergraduate and graduate students rely on Medicaid for health coverage. As long as they attend school more than half-time, they should meet the new work requirement added in the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill". But yet-to-be issued rules and procedures, along with paperwork problems and administrative snafus, could still put many of them at risk. One big problem: The law doesn't actually define what "half-time enrollment" means. Another: The law requires applicants to look back one month to see if they met the work requirement, and it's unclear what that means for a new student who was, for example, on summer break the month before they enrolled. This and many other unanswered questions will likely leave millions of college students' health insurance in limbo as the legislation is implemented.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nSome psychiatric patients may actually have treatable autoimmune conditions. The New Yorker explores the story of one schizophrenia patient who suddenly recovered.\n\nScientists are using AI to boost efforts to spot flags for diseases of extreme tiredness, including long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nChina is facing a major outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya, which has infected more than 4,000 people.\n\nWhite House officials scrapped a plan by the Office of Management and Budget that would have effectively halted NIH grants, and the funds are set to flow again.\n\nTribal health officials are working to fill in vaccination gaps as the U.S. measles outbreak continues to spread.\n\nUnitedHealth Group's profit fell to $3.4 billion in the second quarter, from $4.2 billion in the same period last year, as it grapples with rising costs of providing health insurance to millions of Americans.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy and Ozempic, dropped more than 21% Tuesday, after it cut its guidance to analysts on sales and profit for the year.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\n	RELEVANT
13900652513	St. Marys Daily Press	Noom Invited to White House to Pledge to the CMS Digital Health Ecosystem Shared Framework Empowering People, Integrating AI, and Accelerating Healthcare Access	WASHINGTON, July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Noom , the leading digital healthcare company committed to chronic disease prevention and empowering\n\npeople to live better longer, today announced its commitment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Digital Health Ecosystem Shared Framework during an event at the White House. The company joins other innovators in pledging to help create a connected, standards-based ecosystem that delivers real-world value to patients and providers through secure, user-centered tools.\n\n "We're excited to join forces with CMS on this initiative because it connects prevention and technology in a way that can truly benefit millions," said Geoff Cook, Chief Executive Officer of Noom. "At Noom, we've seen how empowering people with healthy habits and 'food as medicine' can transform lives. Working as part of the CMS ecosystem enables us to scale that approach across America - making healthcare more personalized, proactive, and accessible for everyone."\n\n "Noom applauds the spirit of public-private collaboration underlying this initiative as an accelerant to healthcare innovation," continued Cook. "By joining the CMS ecosystem, Noom can play a part in bringing Americans a modern, connected health experience faster than traditional regulations might, while safeguarding patient health data. In short, this initiative enables modernization of health care by aligning an ecosystem around what patients need. The result should be care that is more convenient, preventive, and tailored to the patient."\n\n As part of its broader commitment to the accessibility goals of the CMS Digital Health Ecosystem, Noom has also pledged to launch a free tier of its app , available to all Americans - regardless of income or BMI - later this summer. Equally accessible to Americans in rural and urban locations, the free version will deliver a personalized experience focused on building healthy habits in nutrition, physical activity, and stress management.\n\n In addition, Noom will begin the necessary development to offer to any Medicare and Medicaid enrolled member free access for 30 days to the full Noom Weight, Noom Diabetes Prevention, and Diabetes Management programs. Even a 30-day jumpstart can drive meaningful habit changes, and Noom expects to demonstrate such outcomes to encourage long-term adoption of preventive care tools.\n\n "Making America healthy again will take an ecosystem," continued Cook. "Life expectancy in the U.S. lags behind other developed nations, while rates of chronic disease - including obesity - continue to rise. We need fresh thinking around nutrition, movement, and lifestyle. Noom is ready to play its part in redefining healthcare as more than disease management. We're excited to bring together our expertise in evidence-based psychology and behavior science, as well as in AI, to offer a free Noom experience for the entire U.S. population, regardless of income. Noom's mission is to empower everyone, everywhere to live better longer."\n\n "Just as importantly," continued Cook, "our work with CMS complements our broader commercial strategy. Noom is already partnering with leading health plans and employers to deliver scalable behavior change programs that lower costs, improve outcomes, and close care gaps. By embedding our approach within the CMS Health Tech Ecosystem, we can bridge public and private efforts-demonstrating how innovation in digital health can support both population health at scale and value-based care in practice. This is more than a collaboration-it's an opportunity to align incentives across payers, providers, and patients, and to bring the full potential of behavior change to the forefront of healthcare transformation."\n\n Noom Health's new whitepaper, " The Food as Medicine Revolution ," shines a spotlight on the urgent need to reimagine healthcare through the lens of nutrition, lifestyle, and prevention. With 70% of the U.S. food supply made up of ultra-processed foods, and 42% of Americans now living with two or more chronic conditions, the time for change is urgent.\n\n The report reveals that 95% of Americans fall short of the recommended vitamin D intake, and 66% of employees with unhealthy diets report lost productivity - underscoring the ripple effects of poor nutrition on both health and the economy. With its pledge to the CMS Digital Health Ecosystem, Noom is advancing a bold, behavior-first approach that addresses the root causes of chronic disease by equipping individuals and organizations with the tools to build lasting, healthy habits.\n\n As part of its commitment to innovation, access, and whole person care, Noom is proud to make three key pledges aligned with CMS's vision for a connected digital health ecosystem.\n\n First, Noom will help prevent and manage diabetes and obesity by connecting to CMS Aligned Networks and personal health record apps, with patient consent, to securely access relevant health data. This will enable the delivery of personalized support-including tailored in-app guidance, prompts to seek clinical care when needed, and insights informed by an individual's real world health history.\n\n Second, in support of the " Kill the Clipboard" initiative , Noom pledges to empower individuals to easily retrieve and share their medical records with providers using QR codes or Smart Health Cards, while returning visit records in the same format whenever possible.\n\n Third, Noom will continue to evolve its conversational AI assistants to integrate with CMS Aligned Networks and personal health record apps. With patient consent, these tools will securely access health data, clearly distinguish between educational content and clinical guidance, and direct users to professional care when appropriate.\n\n These steps represent Noom's promise to eliminate friction, enhance care coordination, and put patients in full control of their health data. Noom's commitment reflects its longstanding mission to make healthy living accessible to everyone and to transform healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.\n\n About Noom:\n\n Noom is the leading whole-person health platform, combining personalized medication with psychology and habit science to help people take control of their metabolic health, weight, and longevity. Noom Health partners with top health plans and employers to offer a suite of solutions, including Noom Med, Noom Weight, Noom GLP-1 Companion, and Noom Diabetes Management and Diabetes Prevention Program to millions.\n\n Founded on a mission to empower everyone everywhere to live better longer, Noom has received multiple National Institute of Health grants and was the first mobile app recognized by the CDC as a certified diabetes prevention program. With offices in New York City and Princeton, NJ, Noom has been named one of Inc.'s Best Places to Work, Quartz's Best Workplaces for Remote Workers, and Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology.\n\n Learn more at noom.com , subscribe to our blog , or follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn\n\n Contact:\n\n Brandyn Bissinger\n\n comms@noom.com\n\n A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d205c039-f957-4f71-bab6-fa5532186353\n\n	IRRELEVANT
13900655096	Washington Post	NYC mass killing raises new security concerns for Corporate America	Security experts say large businesses may look to fortify their offices by adopting tools and protocols already in place at many schools and houses of worship.\n\nA mass killing at a Midtown Manhattan office tower this week has raised new security concerns for American corporations - many still rattled by the targeted killing of a health care CEO in December and the rising specter of violence reaching their doors, even in bustling and seemingly safe business districts.\n\nThough many corporations already have beefed up protections for leadership, some security consultants expect they will move to further fortify their office buildings, kitting them out with key cards and turnstiles and adopting protocols commonly found at schools, houses of worship and other places that faced similar attacks in the past.\n\nRequests for corporate risk assessments have soared since UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson was gunned down late last year, said Glen Kucera, president of enhanced protection services at Allied Universal, a security firm with a global workforce of 800,000. Brands from Intel to Lockheed Martin are earmarking hundreds of thousands of dollars for executive security, and companies are tracking social media for "aggressive rhetoric" that could lead to violence.\n\nThere's been a "sea change" since Thompson was killed while making his way into an investor conference at a Midtown Manhattan hotel late last year, said John Torres of the global consultancy Guidepost Solutions. "We've been getting calls nonstop."\n\nKucera said Allied received more requests for risk assessments in the six months after Thompson's slaying than in the preceding five years combined. The assessments examine social media, office buildings and other factors to gauge the likelihood of violence against employees.\n\nAbout half of Fortune 500 companies provided security details for C-suite executives in May, compared with roughly 20 percent last year, Kucera said. A separate analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 found that 31.3 percent of them provided security benefits as part of executive compensation packages, up from 24.5 percent in 2023 and 23.1 percent in 2022, according to the research firm Equilar.\n\nSome industry observers said there's more that corporations can do to protect their workforces from unexpected and seemingly random attacks, such as installing panic buttons or weapons-detection technology.\n\n"We're badging people in - we're not searching their bags, they're not going through metal detectors," said Amanda DeAlmeida, with Building Security Services, a firm that provides guards for more than 100 properties across New York and New Jersey. They mostly serve as office building concierges, she said.\n\n"Unfortunately, if we're not armed, there's only so much that the guards can do," DeAlmeida added. In the event of an attack, they will follow active-shooter protocols, she said, but without access to panic buttons, loudspeakers or other tools, it's "a lot more difficult" to alert tenants to danger.\n\nMonday's attack follows a spate of violent or politically motivated incidents involving major corporate brands: the Tesla Cybertruck explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, reports of molotov cocktails and gunfire at Tesla lots across the country, and a stabbing attack that injured 11 people at a Michigan Walmart.\n\nAbout 28 percent of public mass shootings - those that weren't at private residences - took place in a workplace, according to a 2023 National Institute of Justice report that synthesized findings from dozens of publications and research projects. Another 13 percent occurred in retail establishments.\n\nThe gunman in Monday's shooting, whom police identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, double parked and entered the lobby of 345 Park Ave. with an AR-style rifle just before 6:30 p.m., according to New York City Police Commissioner Jessica S. Tisch.\n\nHe opened fire, killing off-duty police officer Didarul Islam, who was providing security for the building, and proceeded to spray the lobby with gunfire, Tisch said. Also killed were Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner as she tried to find cover behind a pillar, and guard Aland Etienne, who was shot behind his security desk. Tamura then boarded an elevator - allowing a woman to get off unharmed - and rode it to the 33rd floor, where he killed Rudin Management employee Julia Hyman before shooting himself, authorities said.\n\nSome tenants had time to barricade themselves inside their offices during the attack; employees at private-equity firm Blackstone stacked gray sofas against a door, according to an image circulating on social media and confirmed by the firm.\n\nThis is how the employees in the Blackstone building barricaded themselves inside their offices while the shooter was active. pic.twitter.com/M7pMyWP9zJ\n\n- Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) July 29, 2025\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said in television interviews that Tamura appeared to be targeting the National Football League but took the wrong elevator, arriving at a floor where Rudin Management, a real estate firm and the building manager, has an office. A note found in Tamura's wallet, Adams said, mentioned chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease that the football league has been grappling with for years.\n\nThe NFL did not respond to a request for comment. In a memo to staff, Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote that an NFL employee was seriously injured in the attack, and was in the hospital in stable condition as of Tuesday.\n\nExecutives at Rudin Management could not be reached by phone or email.\n\nWhile most large companies and office towers have some form of security in place, the level varies based on factors that include how high-profile or controversial the firm is, said Fred Burton, executive director of protective intelligence for Ontic, a security firm.\n\nCompanies weigh considerations such as how many people "harbor some degree of hate and discontent against your CEO or the industry that you're with?" he said. "Are you doing work for the - air quote - the 'industrial war machine?'"\n\nAn increasingly polarized political climate has only heightened those concerns, as protests over the Gaza war, immigration policies and other events have spilled onto streets and college campuses and led to company boycotts, some industry observers said.\n\n"It only takes one person to turn around and say, oh, this company is led by someone whose politics they don't like. And they're going to try to get in there and make a statement," said Torres, Guidepost Solutions' president of security and technology consulting.\n\nNew York police have said Luigi Mangione was motivated by animus toward America's health care system when he allegedly shot and killed Thompson on Dec. 4. Before his death, the UnitedHealthcare executive had voiced concerns that the company had an image problem.\n\nSome corporations are being more proactive about security in recognition of the risk of not taking safety seriously, other industry observers said.\n\n"Litigation is, unfortunately, the fallout of poor security or at least perceived poor security," said Ken Wheatley, a former chief security officer for Sony Electronics' global operations who has testified as an expert witness in premise liability and negligent security lawsuits.\n\nCorporate security spending has jumped precipitously, business filings show.\n\nThe technology giant Intel spent $248,900 on the "incremental cost of residential security" for former CEO Patrick Gelsinger in 2024, compared with $1,500 spent on his residential security in 2023, and $1,700 in 2022, company records show. Gelsinger, who stepped down Dec. 1, 2024, also had a car and security-trained driver.\n\nLockheed Martin said it "enhanced" security measures for its senior executives in 2024 to ensure their safety, though there had been risks "for well over a decade," according to a May report. The aerospace and defense company spent $1,194,805 on security for CEO James Taiclet alone that year.\n\nSeveral health care companies made significant investments in security last year. Pharmaceutical giant Merck spent $81,242 installing and maintaining residential, travel and home security for CEO Robert Davis in 2024, compared with $11,824 in 2023, and $6,689 in 2022, filings show.\n\nAnd Centene Corporation said it spent $69,133 on personal security for CEO Sarah London last year, records show. The company, which offers managed health care products and services primarily for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, began to pay personal security costs for some executive officers IN December.\n\nUnitedHealth, where Thompson worked, spent $253,827 on executive security for CFO John Rex in 2024, and $926,989 for Heather Cianfrocco, another executive, filings show. Records did not include a breakdown for executive security in 2023.\n\n	RELEVANT
13900655435	Fitch Ratings	Fitch Revises UnitedHealth's Outlook to Negative; Affirms IFS Ratings at 'AA-'	Fitch Ratings-Chicago-30 July 2025: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-' (Very Strong) Insurer Financial Strength ratings of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's (UnitedHealth) insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, Fitch has affirmed UnitedHealth's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured notes at 'A' and United HealthCare Services, Inc.'s (UHS) IDR at 'A'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.\n\nThe Outlook revision reflects new information disclosed by UnitedHealth in its second quarter earnings call on July 29. The company provided guidance on its significantly diminished operating performance for the remainder of 2025, which suggests that it will meet its financial leverage downgrade sensitivities for the year, with a partial recovery expected in 2026.\n\nKey Rating Drivers\n\nWeakened Operating Performance: Financial performance and earnings is a high influence key rating driver for UnitedHealth's ratings and was very strong until 2025. Operating margins and overall profitability are pressured this year due to continued unexpectedly high trends in healthcare costs, driven by both elevated utilization and unit costs. Based on management guidance, Fitch estimates that the operating EBITDA margin will be approximately 6.5% in 2025, down from 9.8% in 2024.\n\nPressure on Capitalization and Leverage: UnitedHealth's capitalization and leverage highly influence its ratings. Financial leverage metrics have consistently been in line with the rating sensitivities over the past decade but are likely to remain above guidelines for the current rating category in 2025 and possibly into 2026. Based on guidance provided by management in its July 29 earnings call, Fitch estimates that debt/EBITDA will be approximately 2.7x in 2025, up from approximately 2.0x in 2024, which represents the sensitivity for a potential downgrade, and the financial leverage ratio (FLR) will be approximately 43% at year-end.\n\nFavorable Notching on Senior Notes: UnitedHealth's senior unsecured debt rating benefits from the magnitude of unregulated cash flows from the Optum operating segments and results in reduced notching from the IDR.\n\nRisk-Based Capitalization: Fitch estimates the NAIC RBC ratio at YE 2024 for UnitedHealth's NAIC reporting operating subsidiaries at 230% of the company action level (CAL). This level of RBC remains below guidelines for the current rating category but is within management's stated target of 225%-250%. Capitalization remains supportive of the current ratings, and Fitch believes the organization has the willingness and the ability, if needed, to provide financial support to its various operating company subsidiaries.\n\nLeading Position, Significant Scale: UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer and health services provider in terms of total medical membership. Fitch categorizes the company's business profile as "most favorable" under its rating criteria, and companies with this profile can reach a rating in the 'AA' category. The company's credit profile also benefits from significant cash flows derived from its Optum businesses that are less heavily regulated than health insurance.\n\nEmerging Headwinds: Sector developments that may challenge UnitedHealth in its margin recovery efforts include ongoing elevated healthcare utilization trends, potentially higher acuity in the Medicaid risk pool driven by program changes contained in Trump's tax and spending bill signed earlier this month, and the likely expiration of enhanced Premium Tax Credits associated with the Affordable Care Act individual exchange business. The company has also recently acknowledged a Department of Justice investigation into aspects of the company's participation in the Medicare Advantage program. Fitch views the DOJ investigation as an event risk, the outcome of which is impossible to predict at this time.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n--Average debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage ratios exceeding 2.0x and 40%, respectively, on a six-quarter rolling basis;\n\n--Sustained NAIC RBC ratio below 225% of the company action level;\n\n--EBITDA to interest coverage below 10.0x;\n\n--UnitedHealth's unsecured senior debt ratings could be downgraded if Optum's operating EBITDA relative to consolidated interest expense is less than approximately 5.0x or less than 30% of consolidated pretax operating income, or if it becomes encumbered by direct ownership of a regulated subsidiary.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\n--Debt-to-EBITDA and FLRs below 1.4x and 30%, respectively, while maintaining a double-digit EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio;\n\n--NAIC risk-based capital ratio above 250% of the company action level.\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Stable Outlook\n\n--Material improvement of FLR and debt/EBITDA ratio toward 40% and 2.0x, respectively.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nESG Considerations\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

13907559379	Associated Press	Asian shares are mixed after US stocks fall on weakened hopes for a September interest rate cut	MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after most U.S. stocks slipped , as doubts rose on Wall Street about whether the Federal Reserve will deliver economy-juicing cuts to interest rates by September.\n\n Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to 41,020.91 after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.5% and raised inflation projections. The move follows Tokyo's trade deal with Washington.\n\n Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1% to 24,920.67, while the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.7% to 3,588.73.\n\n In Seoul, the Kospi edged down 0.3% to 3,244.40 after South Korea reached a 15% tariff deal with the U.S., with no levies on American goods like cars, trucks and farm products. The deal also includes South Korea's purchase of $100 billion U.S. energy imports and $350 billion worth of investments in the U.S.\n\n Australia's S&P ASX 200 shed 0.1% to 8,743.80. India's BSE Sensex added 0.2% to 81,481.86. Taiwan's TAIEX rose 0.4% to 23,551.92.\n\n Rabo Bank, citing the U.S. trade deals with other countries, including Bangladesh, said in a commentary that "it appears to be only a matter of time before India agrees to terms to ensure that it retains favorable access to the US market and all of those other markets that (U.S. President Donald) Trump has demonstrated he has the power to direct through economic coercion."\n\n Rabo added that the terms of a U.S.-India trade deal would almost certainly include Indian purchases of U.S. arms and energy products and preferential access to U.S. agricultural goods.\n\n ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.\n\n "A potential loser in all of this is Australia. With the US sending more wheat to Indonesia and Bangladesh and more LNG to Japan and South Korea, Australian exports stand to be displaced from their traditional markets," it added.\n\n Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports coming from India , along with an additional tax because of India's purchases of Russian oil, beginning on Aug. 1. That's when stiff tariffs Trump has proposed for many other countries are also scheduled to kick in, unless they reach trade deals that lower the rates. But the U.S. president said the two countries were still in negotiations.\n\n On Wall Street on Wednesday the S&P 500 edged down by 0.1%, coming off its first loss after setting all-time highs for six successive days . The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 171 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%.\n\n Stocks felt pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market after the Federal Reserve voted to hold its main interest rate steady. The move may upset Trump, who has been lobbying for lower interest rates, but it was widely expected on Wall Street.\n\n Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have surprised investors by pushing back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September. Besides Trump, two members of the Fed's committee have also been calling for lower rates to ease the pressure on the economy, and they dissented in Wednesday's vote.\n\n But Powell would not commit to a September cut in rates, pointing to how inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, while the job market still looks to be "in balance."\n\n A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation when Trump's tariffs may be set to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The Fed's job is to keep both the job market and inflation in a good place.\n\n In other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 4 cents to $69.96 per barrel while Brent crude, the international standard, shed 13 cents to $72.34 per barrel.\n\n The U.S. dollar fell to 148.87 Japanese yen from 149.44. The euro rose to $1.1422 from $1.1412.\n\n ___\n\n AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n\n	IRRELEVANT

13902261514	GlobeNewswire	AMA: PBM Markets are at Risk of Harming Patients	CHICAGO, July 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The American Medical Association (AMA) today published a measuring competition in pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) markets and vertical integration of insurers with PBMs. The assessment demonstrates low competition in PBM markets across the nation and high vertical integration as the largest PBMs share ownership with health insurers.\n\nThe AMA analysis adds to growing concern over anticompetitive harm resulting from low competition and high vertical integration in the PBM industry. It comes on the heels of reports by the and finding that a handful of PBMs have vast power and control over medication access and affordability. Both government reports concluded that the unchecked influence of PBMs allows bad actors to inflate drug prices, limit access to necessary medications, and undermine competition.\n\n"As PBMs increasingly act in their own self-interest without transparency or accountability, drug prices rise and patients face health risks from cost prohibitive drug treatments," said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, M.D. "The AMA's analysis is intended to provide insight to help policymakers understand the anticompetitive conditions in the PBM market that can result in harm to patients. The AMA fully supports greater transparency and accountability that is needed to prohibit PBMs from engaging in opaque and harmful business practices."\n\nBased on 2022 and 2023 data on prescription drug plan (PDP) enrollees, the AMA analysis presents a snapshot of PBM market concentration, lists national-level market shares of the 10 largest PBMs, and measures the share of commercial and Medicare Part D PDP enrollees where the insurer and PBM are vertically integrated.\n\nThe findings in the AMA paper highlight whether proposed or consummated mergers among PBMs and between insurers and PBMs should or should have raised antitrust concerns. Low competition may lead to higher prices paid by insurers for PBM services, higher insurance premiums, PBMs not fully passing rebates through, and lower reimbursement to pharmacies. Moreover, given extensive vertical integration of insurers and PBMs, non-affiliated insurers may be losing access to PBMs.\n\nCompetition in PBM Markets\n\nThe PBM market had low competition in 2023 with just four firms having a two-thirds share of the national market, according to the AMA analysis. Competition in the PBM market was assessed based on three functions for which insurers typically hire an external PBM: rebate negotiation, retail network management and claims adjudication. As the AMA's findings are similar across all three functions, the results reported below focus on rebate negotiation.\n\nThe four largest PBMs collectively had a 67% share of the national PBM market in 2023.\n\nOptumRx was the largest PBM in the U.S. in 2023 with a 22.2% market share-up slightly from 20.8% in 2022. It was followed by CVS Health with an 18.9% share-down from 21.3% in 2022. Express Scripts was third largest with a 15.5% share, followed by Prime Therapeutics with a 10.6% share.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of PDP region-level PBM markets lacked adequate competition and were "highly concentrated" according to .\n\nVertical Integration of Insurers and PBMs\n\nThere was significant vertical integration of insurers with PBMs in 2023, according to the AMA analysis.\n\nAt the national level, 77% of commercial and Part D enrollees were in a PDP where the insurer and PBM were vertically integrated.\n\nThe vertically integrated share was higher in Part D than in commercial insurance (88% vs. 71%).\n\nAt the PDP region-level, an average of 76% of enrollees were in a PDP where the insurer and PBM were vertically integrated.\n\nThere was wide variation across PDP regions, with some having little vertical integration between insurers and PBMs, while others are almost entirely vertically integrated.\n\nNine of the 10 largest PBMs share ownership with health insurers.\n\nDrug Insurer Market Shares\n\nThe analysis also lists national-level shares of the 10 largest PDP insurers in 2023 and ranks each according to three PDP markets - commercial, Medicare Advantage PDP, and stand-alone Medicare Part D - as these are the PDP benefits managed by PBMs.\n\nUnitedHealth Group was the largest PDP insurer in the commercial market (13.2% share) and Medicare Advantage market (29.4% share), and third largest in the stand-alone PDP market (18.5% share).\n\nKaiser was the second largest PDP insurer in the commercial market with an 11.0% share, while Humana was second in the Medicare Advantage market and fourth in the stand-alone market with 18.9% and 13.1% shares, respectively.\n\nCVS Health was the biggest PDP insurer in the stand-alone market with 27.2% share, where Centene followed with a 19.7% share.\n\nThe analysis of competition and vertical integration in PBM markets adds to the AMA's work to shine a light on unfair business practices in pharmaceutical drug pricing and alleviate the financial burdens on patients from high drug costs in the U.S. that can be . Protecting patients and physicians from those that game the drug pricing system is a vital issue of public policy for the nation's physicians and the AMA's campaign continues to call for drug pricing transparency.\n\n	RELEVANT

13902261548	Wall Street Journal	CVS Shows Signs of Recovery, Beats Wall Street Expectations -- WSJ	CVS Health reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations and upgraded its projection for 2025, as its health-insurance business showed signs of recovery.\n\nThe healthcare giant's results underscore a split among health insurers. On one side are companies struggling this year with a surprise financial squeeze from higher-than-expected medical costs, a list that includes Centene, Molina Healthcare and the industry bellwether, UnitedHealth Group.\n\nOn the other side, Humana and CVS, which both had major financial challenges last year, say that the higher medical costs are largely in line with what they had projected. Humana, like CVS, had second-quarter results that came in above analysts' predictions, and raised its 2025 guidance.\n\nThe results\n\n-- $1.81: CVS Health's adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter\n\nhandily beat FactSet analysts' expected figure of $1.46 a share, and were\n\nroughly flat compared with the year-ago figure of $1.83.\n\n-- $6.35: The midpoint of CVS's new adjusted earnings per share guidance for\n\nthe full year 2025, which is in the range of $6.30 to $6.40. The prior\n\nguidance was between $6 and $6.20.\n\n-- $1 billion: CVS's net income for the quarter was down from $1.77 billion\n\na year earlier. The drop-off was largely due to two legal settlements\n\nthat totaled $833 million.\n\n-- $98.9 billion: CVS's revenue was up from $91.2 billion in the year-ago\n\nquarter. Higher prescription volume at the company's pharmacies helped\n\nboost this number.\n\n-- 89.9%: The share of insurance premiums at Aetna spent on healthcare costs,\n\nknown as the medical-loss ratio. It is a bit higher than last year's\n\n89.6%, but lower than the FactSet consensus of 90.5%\n\nThe context\n\nHealth-insurance conglomerates have seen their shares drop steeply this year as they have missed earnings expectations and downgraded their projections for the rest of 2025. UnitedHealth's chief executive officer stepped down in May, and the company offered new 2025 guidance this week at a far lower level than it once promised. Centene's and Molina's trajectories were similar.\n\nCVS suffered its own financial blowup -- and CEO replacement -- last year. It took a conservative stance for 2025, promising investors that it would focus on margins in its Medicare business.\n\nThe company says that is paying off. "While we are seeing elevated trends, we actually planned for it and priced for it," said David Joyner, chief executive of CVS Health, in an interview.\n\nStill, CVS did see some bumps. Its group Medicare business will suffer losses this year, and the company says it is locked into multiyear contracts -- most of which expire at the end of 2025 -- that haven't kept up with costs. The company's healthcare clinics that manage the care of seniors are being hit by medical-cost problems.\n\nThe big picture\n\nCVS and its competitors are facing a period of uncertainty over the next few years owing to the policies of the Trump administration and the impact of the Republican tax-and-spending law, which includes changes that are expected to cut into Medicaid enrollment. CVS has already reduced its own future volatility by deciding to pull out of the Affordable Care Act market next year.\n\nFor CVS, which has huge reach across the drug industry owing to its pharmacies and pharmacy-benefit manager, the Trump administration's policies across many issues, including vaccination, drug prices and hospital-medication discounts, could have big impacts down the road.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at Anna.Mathews@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nJuly 31, 2025 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)	RELEVANT
13908594323	Associated Press	Wall Street poised to open higher, boosted by strong earnings from AI-focused technology sector	Wall Street was on track to open with solid gains Thursday on the strength of some blowout quarterly reports from the AI-obsessed technology sector.\n\nFutures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.2% before the opening bell, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.9%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged its counterparts but was still up 0.2%.\n\nFacebook parent company Meta jumped 11.6% overnight after the social media giant crushed Wall Street's sales and profit targets even as the company continues to pour billions of dollars into artificial intelligence.\n\nHelped by higher advertising and a growing user base on its social media platforms, Meta earned $18.34 billion in the quarter, a 36% increase over the same quarter a year ago. Revenue jumped 22%.\n\nAlso posting stellar results was Microsoft, whose shares climbed 8.4% overnight after it also posted better results than analysts were expecting. Microsoft said that annual revenue for its Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. Azure is a centerpiece of Microsoft's efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence. Until Wednesday, the company hadn't disclosed how much money it makes.\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $34.3 billion was up 24% over last year.\n\nEarly Thursday, CVS Health topped Wall Street expectations for the second quarter and hiked its full-year forecast again, as the health care giant rallies under new management after a forgettable 2024 that saw the sector hammered by rising costs.\n\nCVS, whose shares rose 7.5% before markets opened, said all three of its business segments saw revenue growth of 10% or more.\n\nAmazon and Apple report quarterly results after the markets close Thursday.\n\nAlso Thursday, the U.S. releases new data on inflation and layoffs. On Friday, the Labor Department releases its July jobs report.\n\nStocks were pressured by rising Treasury yields after the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate-cut in September is not a sure thing. The Fed has left its rate alone for the past five meetings as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target.\n\nThe odds of a rate cut in September, according to futures pricing, fell from nearly 60% before the meeting to just 45% after the press conference, the equivalent of a coin flip, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has clamored for a rate cut, which would likely give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation when Trump's tariffs may be set to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The Fed's double mandate is to seek maximum employment, while keeping inflation in check.\n\nElsewhere, in Europe at midday, Germany's DAX ticked down 0.1%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.4%. In Paris, the CAC 40 was 0.3% higher.\n\nIn Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.1% to 41,069.82 after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.5% and raised its inflation projections.\n\nIn Seoul, the Kospi edged down 0.3% to 3,245.44 after South Korea reached a 15% tariff deal with the U.S., with no levies on American goods like cars, trucks and farm products. The deal also includes South Korea's purchase of $100 billion in U.S. gas and oil and $350 billion worth of investments in the U.S.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.5% to 24,803.18, while the Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.2% to 3,573.21. Australia's S&P ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,742.80. India's BSE Sensex rose 0.2% to 81,642.81. Taiwan's TAIEX added 0.3% to 23,542.52.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity was weaker than expected in July, with data on Thursday showing the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index PMI slowed to 49.3, down from 49.7.\n\nIn energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 46 cents to $69.54 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, shed 53 cents to $71.96 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 149.90 Japanese yen from 149.51 yen. The euro rose to $1.1445 from $1.1404.	RELEVANT

13902261528	CNBC	Baird downgrades UnitedHealth shares, cites concerns over Optum Health business	Baird thinks UnitedHealth shares could come under even more pressure in the months ahead. The firm downgraded the name to underperform from neutral and slashed its price target by $114 to $198. That implies more than 25% downside potential from Wednesday's closing level. "Our [risk assessment framework] analysis cast doubt on Optum Health, which was confirmed by 2Q25 earnings with [value-based care] long-term margins lowered to 5% and a total v28 implied headwind close to 20% over three years," analyst Michael Ha wrote in a Wednesday note. "With minimal successful offsets/mitigation through Y2 and re-coding back to pre-v28 levels seemingly unrealistic, we have low conviction on UNH's ability to maintain 1% VBC margins in 2026." Shares have seen some pullback this week, falling more than 5%, after the company's earnings forecast for the full year came in well below analyst estimates on Tuesday. While the company's second-quarter revenue just beat expectations, its earnings for the quarter also missed estimates. That slide puts the stock's six-month and year-to-date decline at about 51% and 47%, respectively, both of which are severely lagging the broader market's more than 5% rise in the last six months and more than 8% gain in 2025. UNH 6M mountain UNH, 6-month In addition to concerns surrounding the company's ability to maintain its VBC margins at 1%, Ha said that other segments of the business, excluding Optum Health, look "more challenged than we anticipated," citing Medicare Advantage, Community Group and HIX, Medicare and Medicaid plans and Optum Insight in particular. "Across UHC/OptumInsight/OptumRx, we saw a visible path forward for strong 2026 margin improvement and earnings contribution," the analyst wrote. "However, following the 2Q earnings call, we now see a more challenging fundamental environment into 2026 with greater than expected headwinds across essentially every UHC line of business: MA, Comm Group/HIX, MDCD (and our growing concerns on MDCD work requirements) and surprisingly lower OptumInsight operating margins when excluding/halting portfolio actions." However, most analysts are still bullish on the name, as 19 out of 28 total analysts covering it have a strong buy or buy rating, according to LSEG data. Its consensus target of roughly $346 also calls for more than 30% upside. Shares were down more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday following the downgrade.\n\n	RELEVANT

The company also raised its cash flow from operations guidance to at least $7.5 billion from approximately $7 billion.\n\n CVS Health's second quarter total revenues increased to $98.9 billion, up 8.4% compared to the prior year. The company reported net income of $1 billion in Q2, or 80 cents a share, down from $1.77 billion, or $1.41 a share, the same period a year ago. CVS' net income in the quarter was impacted by litigation charges that include penalties against the company's Omnicare business.\n\n The company's healthcare benefits segment reported revenues of $36 billion, up nearly 12% year-over-year, "primarily driven by increases in the government business, largely due to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program," the company said in a press release.\n\n Adjusted operating income increased 39.4% primarily driven by the "favorable year-over-year impact of changes to the company's individual exchange business risk adjustment estimates, improved underlying performance in the government business and higher favorable prior period development," the company said.\n\n The company's medical benefit ratio in its Aetna unit increased to 89.9% in Q2 from 89.6% in the prior year. For the first six months of 2025, the company's MBR was 88.6%, down from 90% a year ago.\n\n Earlier this year, CVS announced Aetna would exit the individual business under the Affordable Care Act's exchanges in 2026 in a move to improve business performance.\n\n Related\n\n Aetna to exit the ACA exchanges in 2026\n\n CVS Health has 26.7 million members in its Aetna health insurance plans. In Q2, medical membership declined 358,000 members, "reflecting the previously announced membership declines in the individual exchange product line," the company said.\n\n CVS Health also has committed $20 billion over the next decade to simplify the U.S. health system for the American consumer. Specifically, the company is committed to advancing interoperability between members, patients/caregivers, health care providers and appropriate community resource entities to foster collaboration, improve member outcomes and increase satisfaction, the company said.\n\n "What people want most - a connected, simpler health care experience - is what CVS Health uniquely provides. For the 185 million people we serve, we deliver better access, greater affordability and aligned advocacy. Our strong performance demonstrates the continued focus we have on operational and financial improvement across our businesses, led by a significant and durable recovery at Aetna, strong retention at CVS Caremark and growth and momentum at CVS Pharmacy," said David Joyner, CVS Health president and CEO, in a statement.\n\n CVS Health's health services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit management solutions, reported total revenues increased 10.2% to $46 billion. Revenue for the pharmacy and consumer wellness segment grew 12.5% to reach $33.5 billion.\n\n CVS Pharmacy plans to acquire the prescription files of certain Rite Aid pharmacies across 15 states in areas that CVS serves, as well as acquire and operate certain Rite Aid stores in Idaho, Oregon and Washington.\n\n "We are encouraged by a second consecutive quarter of solid 2025 results, while we continue to navigate a dynamic environment," said Brian Newman, Chief Financial Officer of CVS Health, in a statement. "As we execute against our strategic priorities, we remain focused on delivering on our financial commitments and advancing initiatives that create long-term value for our stakeholders."\n\n	RELEVANT

The healthcare giant says its Aetna business is making meaningful progress after going through a realignment. "We're starting to see the results of these efforts, delivering better experiences while also allowing us to better navigate this elevated utilization environment," CEO David Joyner says on an earnings call. But he notes that CVS continues to see pressure in its health-care delivery business stemming from higher medical benefit ratios at Oak Street Health, which it acquired in 2023.

On tariffs, BMW is guiding for a 1.25% impact on automotive sales this year, which could be around 1.5 billion euros. "This total is close to Mercedes' guided total." RBC had previously thought BMW had a smaller U.S. tariff exposure versus Mercedes given BMW exports around 180,000 vehicles from Europe to the U.S. compared with around 190,000 for Mercedes. BMW also exports around 110,000 to the EU/U.K from the U.S., versus around 50,000 for Mercedes. BMW's guidance implies a significant stepdown in tariff impact during the second half, likely aided by mitigation and the new U.S.-EU deal, he says. Shares fall 0.7%.

Cigna's customer relationship counts are closely watched as healthcare and insurance businesses navigate higher medical costs, with some cutting their forecasts, in part due to a shifting membership base.

More than 500 million people in the country use ride-hailing services, completing about 16 billion trips a year, they note. Ride-hailing and taxi services account for a roughly equal share of the on-demand transportation market, they add. Robotaxis compete in the on-demand transport market of higher-tier Chinese cities, which includes 4.5 million to 5 million cars, the analysts write in a note. The robotaxi unit economics in the country may already be close to or at break-even today, excluding the upfront development costs, they say. Barclays estimates the current cost of making a robotaxi in China at about $35,000 to $40,000.

This sent copper contracts on U.S. commodities exchange Comex tumbling around 22% to $4.368 a pound.

The company's organic volumes were down 1.9% versus the expected 0.3% decline, they say. The drop was mainly due to a 6.5% decline in Brazil, including a sharp 9% drop in beer volume in the region. While North America did much better than expected, this wasn't enough to offset volume shortfalls in all the other regions, including China, where volumes fell 7.4%, the analysts add.

President Trump said that 50% tariffs will kick in on August 6. But his order comes with 700 exemptions, including aircrafts and orange juice, "two of the most important items on the bilateral trade list," Marconini says. "Meat and coffee were not exempted from the increase, but this action was ultimately perceived as a first step towards further negotiations," he adds.

There was a fear that pricing changes would overshadow these results, but the opposite happened, Panmure Liberum says in a research note after the U.K. wealth manager's results and provision release. "The level of business production is a clear reminder that pricing is not the be-all-and-end-all for clients that it can be for some in the stock market; advice and relationships matter and St Jimmy's leads the way," analysts write.

(elena.vardon@wsj.com)\n\n0853 ET - The dollar's current gains likely reflect short-term positioning adjustments rather than a reversal of its recent weakening trend, UBS Global Wealth Management analysts say in a note. Investors were probably closing earlier bets against the dollar ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday, where interest rates were held steady, they say. "Once the Fed signals its readiness to resume rate cuts in the coming months, dollar weakness should resume." This view hinges on expectations that U.S. economic growth will soften further in the second half compared to the first half. UBS expects the euro to rise to $1.20 later this year. It last trades up 0.3% at $1.1443, having reached a seven-week low of $1.1399 Wednesday, LSEG data show.

The U.K. bank cuts its net income forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by almost 28% and nearly 18%, respectively. Nonetheless, management's commentary around a potential recovery in orders in the third quarter is seen as encouraging as the bank anticipates a demand rebound in 2026.

The U.S.-EU trade deal could hurt eurozone growth due to the 15% tariff on the bloc, they say. However, the euro should still benefit from the dollar falling as changing U.S. policies could alter global demand for U.S. assets, they say. A gradual shift away from the dollar should continue as global portfolios rebalance to more diversified allocations in risky assets, they say. The dollar could also continue to lose market share in cross-border payments.

The Italian carmaker has given a floor that it now says it has stronger confidence in reaching, though consensus is already above these levels.

13907432156	Dow Jones	June GDP Lift Gives Canada Economy Solid Springboard Into 3Q -- Market Talk	0934 ET - At the very least, Canada's monthly GDP data signals the economy will likely improve in 3Q after a rebound in June. Officially, GDP in May fell 0.1%, after a similar drop in the prior month. Statistics Canada though estimates GDP by industry rose 0.1% in June, which puts 2Q GDP--excluding investment and expenditures--on track toward a 0.2% annualized decline. Capital Economics says May's drop can be attributed to temporary factors, such as retooling at refineries in the energy patch. Public administration declined, which was payback for April's election-driven gain. While GDP likely contracted in 2Q, "we do not expect that to be repeated this quarter," says CapEcon, about 3Q.

The health services segment gains 10% to $46.45 billion, which it attributes to pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation.

The healthcare giant's health care benefits segment saw revenue rise 12% to $36.26 billion, which it attributed to increases in government business, largely due to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program. The health services segment gains 10% to $46.45 billion, which it attributes to pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation.

13907431141	Dow Jones	Canada Weathers Peak Tariff Uncertainty With Only Slight Damage -- Market Talk	0945 ET - Canada's economy appears to have navigated through peak trade uncertainty with less damage than initially feared, based on Statistics Canada's monthly GDP report. Output in May fell 0.1% but--according to an early estimate--rose 0.1% in June. "Pretty much everyone would have gladly taken Statcan's estimate of flat output in 2Q as a big win," says Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The Bank of Canada projects a 1.5% annualized drop in 2Q, whereas Statcan's GDP industry report--which excludes investment and spending--points to a 0.2% contraction. The BOC "may be slightly surprised by the initial stable result for 2Q GDP," Porter says.

This is despite Ferrari's history of exceeding expectations, as evidenced by the fact its last quarterly EPS miss was five years ago, he adds. The company's second-quarter adjusted EPS of 2.38 euros was ahead of the 2.31 euros expected by consensus, while net revenue rose 4% to 1.79 billion euros--50 million euros short of consensus. Full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance was maintained for at least 7 billion euros and 8.60 euros, respectively. Shares fall 6.2%.

Statistics Canada though estimates GDP by industry rose 0.1% in June, which puts 2Q GDP--excluding investment and expenditures--on track toward a 0.2% annualized decline. Capital Economics says May's drop can be attributed to temporary factors, such as retooling at refineries in the energy patch. Public administration declined, which was payback for April's election-driven gain. While GDP likely contracted in 2Q, "we do not expect that to be repeated this quarter," says CapEcon, about 3Q.

Output in May fell 0.1% but--according to an early estimate--rose 0.1% in June. "Pretty much everyone would have gladly taken Statcan's estimate of flat output in 2Q as a big win," says Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The Bank of Canada projects a 1.5% annualized drop in 2Q, whereas Statcan's GDP industry report--which excludes investment and spending--points to a 0.2% contraction. The BOC "may be slightly surprised by the initial stable result for 2Q GDP," Porter says.

The company now has its work cut out to hit the current EPS consensus of 9.05 euros for 2025, he notes. This is despite Ferrari's history of exceeding expectations, as evidenced by the fact its last quarterly EPS miss was five years ago, he adds. The company's second-quarter adjusted EPS of 2.38 euros was ahead of the 2.31 euros expected by consensus, while net revenue rose 4% to 1.79 billion euros--50 million euros short of consensus. Full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance was maintained for at least 7 billion euros and 8.60 euros, respectively. Shares fall 6.2%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n\n0934 ET - At the very least, Canada's monthly GDP data signals the economy will likely improve in 3Q after a rebound in June. Officially, GDP in May fell 0.1%, after a similar drop in the prior month. Statistics Canada though estimates GDP by industry rose 0.1% in June, which puts 2Q GDP--excluding investment and expenditures--on track toward a 0.2% annualized decline. Capital Economics says May's drop can be attributed to temporary factors, such as retooling at refineries in the energy patch. Public administration declined, which was payback for April's election-driven gain. While GDP likely contracted in 2Q, "we do not expect that to be repeated this quarter," says CapEcon, about 3Q.

The healthcare giant's health care benefits segment saw revenue rise 12% to $36.26 billion, which it attributed to increases in government business, largely due to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program. The health services segment gains 10% to $46.45 billion, which it attributes to pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. The pharmacy and consumer wellness segment gains 13% to $33.58 billion, which it pins on pharmacy drug mix and increased prescription and front store volume.

(denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)\n\n0932 ET - Statistics Canada says that early indicators point a 0.1% jump in June GDP from the prior month, which means that 2Q GDP is tracking toward a flat reading. On the surface, that's considerably better than the 1.5% annualized drop the Bank of Canada expects. However, the monthly GDP data from Statistics Canada is based on industry production, whereas the quarterly GDP report also takes into account spending and investment. CIBC Capital Markets notes that in 1Q, the expenditure data were much stronger than the industry figures, leading to the surprise 2.2% increase. "It's quite possible that we see the reverse of that in 2Q," says Andrew Grantham, a CIBC economist. Trade-fueled uncertainty has prompted companies to keep a lid on business investment, while consumers are cautious on spending plans, according to BOC research.

But his order comes with 700 exemptions, including aircrafts and orange juice, "two of the most important items on the bilateral trade list," Marconini says.

On an analyst call, executives say tariffs are more than just higher costs, however, because they could affect also how buyers purchase additional toy inventory, as well as how customers spend their dollars on discretionary goods, such as toys. Executives figure that tariffs will have a cost of about $90 million, but that the company has certain cost-savings measures to the tune of $60 million to $65 million. Spin Master slides 12% on a wider 2Q loss as revenue fell due to pressure on U.S. retailers from tariffs.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n\n0958 ET - The second largest poultry company, Pilgrim's Pride, says the chicken business is booming. Demand for boneless skinless breasts, and even dark meats such as thighs and leg quarters, are seeing increasing consumer purchases. Sales for the quarter that ended June 29 rose 4% to $4.8 billion. Beef prices have hit all-time highs due to a cattle shortage in the U.S., pushing some consumers to chicken, Pilgrim's executives say. Lower grain prices are also helping to cut the company's livestock feed costs. Despite a slowdown in restaurant traffic because of the rising cost of eating out, Pilgrim's executives say chicken is a bright spot.

Industry-level GDP again fell 0.1% on-month in May, and is estimated to have risen a modest 0.1% in June. The two economists note the trade war with the U.S. is at a pivotal juncture that could materially alter Canada's economic prospects for the second half of 2025. A trade deal by Friday looks unlikely, which means Canada faces higher tariffs that could extend the downturn through the end of the year, they say.

The health services segment gains 10% to $46.45 billion, which it attributes to pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. The pharmacy and consumer wellness segment gains 13% to $33.58 billion, which it pins on pharmacy drug mix and increased prescription and front store volume. Shares rise 6% to $66.03 in premarket trading. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)\n\n0931 ET - Schroders's results were at least in line with market expectations and in many areas much better, Panmure Liberum says in a research note. The U.K. asset manager posted net inflows and positive market movements for the first half, which lifted its assets under management to 670.6 billion pounds. "The market has been churlish in grasping the fundamental changes being undertaken at Schroders, both in respect of expected profits and also the multiple which is applied to estimated earnings; we see upside in both," the analysts write. They add that the group is running comfortably ahead of schedule to remove costs. Shares fall 0.5% to 388 pence and are up 20% year to date. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)\n\n0928 ET -- CVS Health's latest results show how split health insurers are. The healthcare giant says its Aetna business is making meaningful progress after going through a realignment. "We're starting to see the results of these efforts, delivering better experiences while also allowing us to better navigate this elevated utilization environment," CEO David Joyner says on an earnings call. But he notes that CVS continues to see pressure in its health-care delivery business stemming from higher medical benefit ratios at Oak Street Health, which it acquired in 2023. Some health insurers like Centene and UnitedHealth Group are struggling this year as they deal with a surprise financial squeeze from higher-than-expected medical costs, while on the other side some like Humana and CVS are doing better after facing financial challenges last year. CVS shares rise 7% to $66.63 in premarket trading on raised 2025 guidance and 2Q results above estimates.

13907430901	Dow Jones	AB InBev's Results Aren't All Bad -- Market Talk	1115 ET - Anheuser-Busch InBev's weak sales volumes are a flashpoint for investors, but the Bud brewer's second-quarter results also have some bright spots, Jefferies analysts say in a research note. Outside of Brazil and China, the group's volumes were up 0.7% organically, and this includes notable growth in Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, strength for premium brands in Europe and market-share gains in the U.S., Jefferies says. Moreover, the company posted strong earnings, delivering the 15th consecutive quarter with organic Ebitda growth within the 4% to 8% range, Jefferies says. It is also reducing its debt ratios and progress on that front means a buyback could be launched when it reports third-quarter results, the analysts say. Shares fall 11%. (adria.calatayud@wsj.com)\n\n1030 ET - Bombardier's business jet demand is still strong, which TD Cowen's Tim James says should put investors at ease. The analyst points to the 2Q book-to-bill ratio and the company's reiterated delivery and revenue guidance which "shows no signs of cracks in the business jet cycle, and should be reassuring given the global economic environment." This is also manifesting in higher services revenue, which topped expectations and peers, James says. "Lower... adjusted Ebitda margin impacted by delivery mix, though offsetting this impact should have been higher services revenue," he adds. Shares are down 4.2% to C$155.87.(adriano.marchese@wsj.com)\n\n1023 ET - Canada's payrolls report for May, combined with a positive revision in April, indicate a bit more momentum in the labor market, says Royce Mendes, managing director at Desjardins Capital Markets. Still, Mendes says softness pervades in the job market, based on a decline in job vacancies. The data show job vacancies fell to their lowest level since October, 2017, and declined nearly 16% from a year ago. "The economic slack remains evident across a number of indicators," says Mendes, adding wage growth is also slowing. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)\n\n1014 ET - The latest Canadian GDP report suggests economic activity was essentially unchanged in 2Q, though Statistics Canada's more comprehensive quarterly expenditure figures due in late August are expected to show a contraction similar to the 1.5% decline projected by the Bank of Canada, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo andMichael Davenport say. Industry-level GDP again fell 0.1% on-month in May, and is estimated to have risen a modest 0.1% in June. The two economists note the trade war with the U.S. is at a pivotal juncture that could materially alter Canada's economic prospects for the second half of 2025. A trade deal by Friday looks unlikely, which means Canada faces higher tariffs that could extend the downturn through the end of the year, they say. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)\n\n0958 ET - The second largest poultry company, Pilgrim's Pride, says the chicken business is booming. Demand for boneless skinless breasts, and even dark meats such as thighs and leg quarters, are seeing increasing consumer purchases. Sales for the quarter that ended June 29 rose 4% to $4.8 billion. Beef prices have hit all-time highs due to a cattle shortage in the U.S., pushing some consumers to chicken, Pilgrim's executives say. Lower grain prices are also helping to cut the company's livestock feed costs. Despite a slowdown in restaurant traffic because of the rising cost of eating out, Pilgrim's executives say chicken is a bright spot. "Chicken demand grew as operators strategically lean into value offerings, limited type production, promotions and menu revisions to either trigger or maintain momentum," said Pilgrim's CEO Fabio Sandri on a call with analysts. (patrick.thomas@wsj.com)\n\n0945 ET - Canada's economy appears to have navigated through peak trade uncertainty with less damage than initially feared, based on Statistics Canada's monthly GDP report. Output in May fell 0.1% but--according to an early estimate--rose 0.1% in June. "Pretty much everyone would have gladly taken Statcan's estimate of flat output in 2Q as a big win," says Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The Bank of Canada projects a 1.5% annualized drop in 2Q, whereas Statcan's GDP industry report--which excludes investment and spending--points to a 0.2% contraction. The BOC "may be slightly surprised by the initial stable result for 2Q GDP," Porter says. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)\n\n0936 ET - Ferrari's top-line growth has slowed dramatically due to lower sales volumes, says Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. The company now has its work cut out to hit the current EPS consensus of 9.05 euros for 2025, he notes. This is despite Ferrari's history of exceeding expectations, as evidenced by the fact its last quarterly EPS miss was five years ago, he adds. The company's second-quarter adjusted EPS of 2.38 euros was ahead of the 2.31 euros expected by consensus, while net revenue rose 4% to 1.79 billion euros--50 million euros short of consensus. Full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance was maintained for at least 7 billion euros and 8.60 euros, respectively. Shares fall 6.2%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)\n\n0934 ET - At the very least, Canada's monthly GDP data signals the economy will likely improve in 3Q after a rebound in June. Officially, GDP in May fell 0.1%, after a similar drop in the prior month. Statistics Canada though estimates GDP by industry rose 0.1% in June, which puts 2Q GDP--excluding investment and expenditures--on track toward a 0.2% annualized decline. Capital Economics says May's drop can be attributed to temporary factors, such as retooling at refineries in the energy patch. Public administration declined, which was payback for April's election-driven gain. While GDP likely contracted in 2Q, "we do not expect that to be repeated this quarter," says CapEcon, about 3Q.

(denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)\n\n0932 ET - Statistics Canada says that early indicators point a 0.1% jump in June GDP from the prior month, which means that 2Q GDP is tracking toward a flat reading. On the surface, that's considerably better than the 1.5% annualized drop the Bank of Canada expects. However, the monthly GDP data from Statistics Canada is based on industry production, whereas the quarterly GDP report also takes into account spending and investment. CIBC Capital Markets notes that in 1Q, the expenditure data were much stronger than the industry figures, leading to the surprise 2.2% increase. "It's quite possible that we see the reverse of that in 2Q," says Andrew Grantham, a CIBC economist. Trade-fueled uncertainty has prompted companies to keep a lid on business investment, while consumers are cautious on spending plans, according to BOC research. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com)\n\n0928 ET - Brazil gets tariff exemption for most of its exports to the U.S. even without extensive negotiations, in a sign that further improvement is possible, Teneo's Mario Marconini writes. President Trump said that 50% tariffs will kick in on August 6. But his order comes with 700 exemptions, including aircrafts and orange juice, "two of the most important items on the bilateral trade list," Marconini says. "Meat and coffee were not exempted from the increase, but this action was ultimately perceived as a first step towards further negotiations," he adds. Trump has declined Brazilian President Lula's call for a meeting. The Brazilian real weakens 0.5% against the dollar.

Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\n\n Top 5 Upgrades:\n\n HSBC upgraded Meta Platforms\n\n META ) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $900, up from $610.

The firm says the fears of its downgrade in April have not played out\n\n BMO Capital upgraded eBay\n\n EBAY ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $102, up from $70. The firm sees the company's focus categories accelerating growth and driving upside to fiscal 2025 estimates.\n\n Citi upgraded CoreWeave\n\n CRWV ) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $160. The firm also closed its "90-day negative catalyst watch" on CoreWeave with the stock down 45% from its peak.

Loop Capital also downgraded SPS Commerce to Hold from Buy with a price target of $120, down from $175.\n\n Truist downgraded Fortive\n\n FTV ) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $55, down from $60. With a new management team in place and a more streamlined portfolio, Fortive has "the potential to finally deliver on its financial targets and drive consistent earnings growth," but the firm is moving to the sidelines as it views the stock as "a show-me story" given what it says are "less aspirational organic growth targets relative to peers."\n\n KeyBanc downgraded Palo Alto Networks\n\n PANW ) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target following the announced acquisition of CyberArk\n\n CYBR ).

The Hess acquisition boosts Chevron's upstream trajectory, particularly in Guyana, while maintaining disciplined capital spending, says the firm, which sees strategic moves positioning Chevron for strong free cash flow growth.\n\n Maxim initiated coverage of Galaxy Digital\n\n GLXY ) with a Buy rating and $40 price target. Maxim expects Galaxy's gross profit to grow 88% in 2026 and 78% in 2027, reflecting contracted datacenter lease payments from CoreWeave (CRWV) and stronger institutional demand for digital assets.

Citi sees an opportunity for the company to monetize its free user base.\n\n Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Lexeo Therapeutics\n\n LXEO ) with an Outperform rating and $20 price target.

MP's public-private partnership with the DoD, along with its commercial deal to provide Apple\n\n AAPL ) with recycled permanent magnets in the U.S., has "materially transformed the company's business model for the next 10+ years," the firm tells investors.\n\n Published first on - the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.\n\n	RELEVANT

13907437553	Fierce Healthcare	'Humming on all cylinders': Alignment Healthcare CEO inks profit milestone, eyes growth	Medicare Advantage (MA) payer Alignment Healthcare is raising its full-year guidance across the board after its first-ever profitable quarter as a public corporation, the insurer announced Wednesday.\n\n Alignment, an upstart in the health insurance field, secured a quarterly net income of $15.7 million, days after industry leader UnitedHealthcare announced intent to leave certain MA markets and other health plans announce wobbly earnings.\n\n The financial results highlight a paradigm shift in delivering care and offering insurance, CEO John Kao told Fierce Healthcare in an interview Thursday.\n\n Traditional insurers use, in his words, "financial engineering" to generate strong performance, in the form of coding, global capitation and prior authorizations. Alignment's model puts extra emphasis on identifying the seniors who need the costliest care to decrease hospitalizations, not financially relying on risk adjustment reimbursement from the federal government and a "maniacal" attention to the stars rating program.\n\n "And, by the way, we're only two-thirds of the way through the V28 risk adjustment model phase-in and everyone's blowing up," he said, referencing an ongoing regulatory shift imposed on payers. "What do you think is going to happen when the final phase-in hits next year? We're the contrarians, if you will, to the incumbents."\n\n The company is opting to improve its full-year outlook for membership, revenue, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA after surpassing the high end of its guidance for the second quarter.\n\n Notably, the insurer also beat the high end of its adjusted EBITDA guidance of $60 million after just two quarters. So far, Alignment has recorded $66.1 million in adjusted EBITDA.\n\n Related\n\n Alignment Healthcare grows Q1 revenue to $927M, hires former MultiPlan CFO\n\n The stark overperformance is rooted in its Alignment's Virtual Applications (AVA) tech platform used by the company's Care Anywhere program to fill care coordination gaps and improve preventive treatment for polychronic individuals, said Kao.\n\n "What we did was we partnered more with our downstream delegate medical groups and our independent physician associations such that we are doing more of the clinical work along with them," he said. "That's allowed us to get even better outcomes from a clinical quality point of view."\n\n The insurer also earned payments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services due to upsized growth in 2024, boosting the company's incremental gross profit by an extra $14 million.\n\n Alignment crossed the $1 billion quarterly revenue threshold in the second quarter, a 49% improvement year over year. The insurer can also claim 223,700 members, a 27% increase over this time last year, and its medical benefits ratio was 86.7%.\n\n Related\n\n JPM25: Alignment Healthcare, Clover Health dish on future prospects\n\n Part of Alignment's success comparative to other insurers is its lack of exposure in the Medicaid and Affordable Care Act exchange businesses, said analysts with William Blair. While the company's stock had dipped 26% in the last three months, those struggles are likely a result of skepticism surrounding the environment impacting other lines of business and payers-not an indictment on Medicare Advantage or Alignment specifically.\n\n "Moreover, with Alignment, we continue to see a differentiated model that is humming on all cylinders, balancing strong growth with medical cost management, investments in care delivery and the member experience, and operating expense discipline," a note following the earnings call read.\n\n Now, the insurer hopes to achieve up to $3.91 billion in revenue in 2025 and have 229,000 to 234,000 members. Its estimated adjusted EBITDA is $69 million to $83 million.\n\n "I'd say the other thing we did was the investments that we've made in AI and in core system automation are beginning to pay off in the form of increased operating leverage, and we're getting big enough in size," explained Kao, noting the company's selling, general and administrative expenses were 8.8% for the quarter.\n\n Related\n\n AHIP 2025: A look at the current policy environment around Medicare Advantage\n\n Kao said Alignment has explored the potential of agentic AI. While it's unlikely they become a "bleeding edge" player, he foresees the company being a "very, very fast follower."\n\n Earlier this month, a judge ruled partially in favor of the company in a star ratings lawsuit, boosting the scores of select plans. Bids for the upcoming year 2026 were modified.\n\n "Since its initial phase-in in 2024, and along with star ratings declines across the industry, large incumbent MCOs have lost share in MA for the first time since 2014," Kao said during the earnings call.\n\n Alignment is eyeing opportunities to expand membership and enter new markets in 2027 as the company finds its footing. As early as next year, Kao wants to invest in scaling and advertising the insurer's brand.\n\n "That's the piece that we're kind of underplaying ... we can blow this thing out throughout the country," he said. "That's where it gets super exciting because I think every single senior in this country deserves to get the kind of care we offer relative to their alternatives."\n\n	RELEVANT

It is the greatest responsibility of my career, and I am eager to support Acorn Health as we connect more communities with the best clinical care in the ABA space."\n\n Along with Bryant's appointment, Acorn Health announces the following senior leadership promotions to drive innovation in autism care nationwide:\n\n Krista Orellana (Boe), M.A., BCBA, has been named executive vice president of growth and chief clinical officer. In this role, she leads initiatives to drive overall census growth, strengthen payer relationships and support inclusive access to services across Acorn Health. Orellana joined the organization in 2015 and previously served as chief clinical and compliance officer and clinical director of Northern Michigan operations. She has served on the Michigan Autism Council since 2018 and has been recognized twice as one of the Top 50 Women Leaders of Michigan by Women We Admire. She holds a bachelor's degree in psychology and biology from Central Michigan University and a master's degree in applied behavior analysis from Western Michigan University.\n\n Scott Semmel has been named senior vice president of payer relations. In this role, he focuses on aligning payer engagement with clinical access and organizational goals. Semmel joined Acorn Health in early 2025 as vice president of payer relations. He serves on the board of directors for the Pediatric Cancer Foundation of the Lehigh Valley and as public policy committee chair for the Pennsylvania Homecare Association. He holds a bachelor's degree in biology from DeSales University.\n\n About Acorn Health:\n\n Acorn Health is accredited by the Autism Commission on Quality and offers both center-based and in-home services nationwide in more than 70 centers located throughout Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. Founded in 2018, Acorn is committed to providing industry-leading quality clinical care through applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy to give children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) the opportunity to live more independent and meaningful lives.\n\n Cases of ASD are on the rise; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 31 children is living with ASD. ABA therapy, a program endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General, provides individualized plans for each patient based on agreed upon clear, measurable goals with the child's family. Acorn Health uses its proprietary Behavioral Health Index to measure success in ways that are easily understood by families, clinicians and educators.\n\n To learn more about Acorn Health, visit AcornHealth.com/ and to learn about career opportunities, visit AcornHealth.com/careers\n\n To inquire about ABA therapy at Acorn Health, please call 844.244.1818.\n\n Follow us at Facebook.com/AcornHealthABA, Instagram.com/acornhealthaba, and LinkedIn.com/company/acornhealth.\n\n View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250731686502/en/\n\n Media contact:Lynne Blasi, 703.582.3973, lynne@bluewagongroup.com\n\n KEYWORD: UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA FLORIDA\n\n INDUSTRY KEYWORD: MENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE PARENTING CHILDREN FINANCE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PRACTICE MANAGEMENT GENERAL HEALTH CONSUMER HEALTH\n\n SOURCE: Acorn Health\n\n Copyright Business Wire 2025.\n\n PUB: 07/31/2025 03:10 PM/DISC: 07/31/2025 03:10 PM\n\n http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250731686502/en\n\n	IRRELEVANT

13907442446	Fierce Healthcare	Evernorth growth, checked medical cost exposure delivers solid Q2 for Cigna	Cigna Group reaffirmed its 2025 guidance Thursday on the back of solid growth within its Evernorth businesses and limited exposure to higher costs embroiling government-backed plans.\n\n The company reported total revenues of $67.2 billion in Q2, up 11% year over year and well ahead of the $62.7 billion consensus estimate.\n\n Net income landed at $1.5 billion or $5.71 per share with adjusted income from operations hitting $1.9 billion or $7.20 per share, the latter of which narrowly topped Wall Street's $7.16 forecast. Each of those numbers were slight improvements over Q2 2024's earnings performance.\n\n Adjusted revenues within its insurance division dropped 18% year over year to $10.8 billion, but would have increased 7% when discounting the company's recent sale of its Medicare business to Health Care Service Corporation . Adjusted income from operations (pre-tax) also dipped 9% year over year to $1.1 billion.\n\n Though that deal helped protect Cigna from the skyrocketing costs peers like Molina Healthcare Centene and UnitedHealthcare reported on the marketplaces, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, it still reported a year-over-year rise in medical cost ratio from 82.3% to 83.2%.\n\n The company attributed the increase to higher stop loss medical costs among its employer customer base. Speaking Thursday morning, executives said that the stop loss portfolio is broadly in line with the company's expectations-the company is projecting a full-year medical cost ratio between 83.2% and 84.2% as costs remain elevated throughout the year.\n\n Executives also said that elevated costs will drive employer adoption of Cigna's "more disruptive" offerings, and noted that commercial client renewals have included revised cost structures while preserving demand.\n\n "All of the stop loss business that we write is through an integrated offering with the employer where we also administer their overall medical benefits-and we continue to see very strong market demand for these solutions as evidenced by the 13% growth in stop loss premiums in the second quarter," Cigna Group President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Evanko said on the morning's earnings call. "As we've talked about on prior calls, we're working to improve the margin profile on this business over the course of the next two renewal cycles, and we're confident in our ability to deliver against this."\n\n Related\n\n AHIP 2025: Why Cigna is making a 'pledge to better' to its members\n\n While its insurance business slightly tightened, Cigna leaned on its Evernorth segments to deliver revenue growth. Here, adjusted revenues rose 17%, split between 20% within pharmacy benefit services "reflecting strong organic growth" and 13% for specialty and care services "reflecting strong specialty volume growth." Adjusted income from operations was 5% higher year over year across the segment-2% within pharmacy benefit services and 7% within specialty and care services.\n\n Executives touted a broad swath of offerings, such as a newly launched GLP-1 benefit option negotiated directly with drug manufacturers, and the high-growth potential of specialty medications as drivers of continued growth for both portions of the Evernorth segment.\n\n In response to a question regarding Evernorth's tepid margins, Evanko and Ann Dennison, Cigna Group chief financial officer, pointed to a combination of investment income headwinds, large volume but low margin client renewals and higher priced drug sales.\n\n "We feel really good about the strength of the business and the ability to drive sustained growth across both of those businesses," Dennison said.\n\n Cigna is projecting at least $29.60 adjusted income from operations per share across the full year. Despite topping the market's estimates, the company's stock was trading about 8% below open as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n	RELEVANT

13908433828	Business Insider	I run an NYC security business. I'm getting calls for more protection after the Midtown shooting.	Tom Buda worked for the NYPD before starting his private security business in Manhattan.\n\nBuda said he's received requests for increased security measures since Monday's shooting.\n\nHe shared how private security personnel are trained to protect office buildings.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tom Buda, the owner of a private security business in New York, following a fatal shooting at a Midtown office building. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter Monday's shooting at an office building in Midtown Manhattan, I immediately started getting calls from clients asking for additional security. First, I checked that everyone I work with was OK. Then, I worked most of the night to add security to different sites.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, I had about 12 calls from new clients for increased security through at least Friday.\n\nI run Buda Security, a private security business on Park Avenue that I founded in 1998, 14 years after I joined the New York City Police Department. After I retired from the NYPD in 2005, I worked with the UN in various security roles until 2018. Then I focused on my security business.\n\nI have clients working near 345 Park Ave., the building that the shooter targeted. We do private and corporate security, special events, executive protection, hotels, residential buildings, and events in the city.\n\nSince the UnitedHealth CEO was shot last year, existing clients and new clients have decided to spend more money on security drivers and security for their CEOs.\n\nSecurity for an office building can sometimes get boring and quiet. We train our guards not to be complacent and remind them that something like what happened on Monday could happen at any moment.\n\nWe tell our team to be proactive. You can check your phone, but don't look at it for a long period of time. Go to the door and look outside. We tell them to check the Citizen App. Many of our guys are either active or retired NYPD or federal agents, so they have contacts in the precinct and can reach out to assess any news.\n\nIn a bigger office building like the one targeted on Monday, companies will usually employ their own security at the desk that checks people in with appointments. We are typically called out to supplement their unarmed security when there is a threat. We have unarmed security, too. Our guards are usually in the office or outside the building, rather than in the lobby.\n\nIn an active shooter situation, we will use the force necessary to stop the threat. For our armed people, deadly force may be appropriate and necessary.\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nWhen it comes to our employees, we check their training prior to hiring. All of our armed personnel are either active or former law enforcement officers or have special training. They are trained by the law enforcement agency they've come from on how to engage with an active shooter. Even though we don't only hire active or retired law enforcement, they get priority.\n\nAlso, clients will sometimes hire us alongside an off-duty detail officer, who is also paid by the company. The uniformed NYPD officer who was killed on Monday had been hired in the building as security.\n\nEvery client should have a plan for dealing with these kinds of situations, from locking the building down to shutting off the elevators. Contingency planning is everything.\n\nThe main question I have about the Manhattan shooting is how the active shooter got so high and far into the building. I think after this shooting and the UnitedHealth CEO shooting, threats are going to be handled differently.\n\nMany changes could be made to prevent a shooter from getting far into a building. For example, buildings can add turnstiles that might slow down people getting into elevator banks or funnel them into a narrow area where they can be filmed or observed by a security guard.\n\nCorporate security directors, store owners, and anyone with employees are responsible for understanding how important security is. Although incidents like this may only happen a couple of times a year, preparation can make a difference.\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n	RELEVANT
13909984504	New York Times	Manhattan Has More Secure Buildings Than Most Cities. That Wasn't Enough.	Decades of threats have heightened security in New York City. But Monday's attack in a Park Avenue office building shows the limits of preparedness.\n\nAt the heart of the horrific shooting that killed four people at a Manhattan office building on Monday is a tragic irony: All things considered, the building at 345 Park Avenue was relatively well prepared to withstand a violent attack.\n\nIt had security personnel - a police officer and at least one security guard in the lobby. It had turnstiles that required a badge to be scanned. And many tenants of the building had the presence of mind to barricade themselves in offices once it became clear that an armed intruder had entered.\n\n"As horrible and heartbreaking as it is that people lost lives in this, it could have been a lot worse had they not had that security protocol," said Glen Kucera of Allied Universal, which provides security to hundreds of large companies.\n\nHe said that additional security might have stopped the attacker but that it was very difficult to completely neutralize an armed assailant who had "made up his mind to hurt people" and was willing or even determined to die. The gunman double-parked his car near the building and began firing upon entering. He killed four people before turning the gun on himself.\n\nExperts on building security say most large office buildings in New York City have something resembling the security measures at the Park Avenue building. They said the real question wasn't so much whether New York buildings would take additional steps in the aftermath of Monday's tragedy, but whether buildings and employers in other cities might revise their approaches to be more like those in Manhattan.\n\n"New York is the one city in America where, by far, virtually all high-end buildings have turnstiles," said Mark Ein, the executive chairman of Kastle Systems, a building security firm with clients around the country. That is not the case in most cities, he said.\n\nNew York office buildings have been bolstering their security for decades, amid terrorist attacks and other threats. Experts said there was an additional ramp-up when harassment and violent crime increased earlier this decade.\n\nChris Pierson, the chief executive of BlackCloak, a firm that provides digital security to top corporate personnel, said that the company noticed a sharp rise of online harassment of executives in 2022 and 2023, and that this was often a "leading indicator" of harassment in person.\n\nSecurity spending appears to have climbed in line with that trend. From 2021 to 2024, spending on executive security by a typical S&P 500 company that discloses such information more than doubled, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm.\n\nThen came the shooting of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel in December. That attack alarmed many executives and seemed to have led to a tightening of security procedures in other buildings.\n\n"Our security program was enhanced following the UHC shooting," one corporate official wrote in response to a survey by the Partnership for New York City, a group of more than 300 large companies with a significant presence in New York.\n\n"That included adding additional armed security, external surveillance and intelligence resources. We also added the N.Y.P.D. paid overtime detail, which is a critical component of our program," the official said, referring to the New York Police Department. The survey was conducted after Monday's Park Avenue killings.\n\nSince the shooting this week, Mr. Kucera of Allied Universal said companies had inquired about putting in place additional security measures. This could include canine teams or a so-called hostile surveillance specialist program, which involves stationing plainclothes armed guards outside a building.\n\nMr. Kucera said that only about 20 percent of the hundreds of Fortune 500 companies that did business with Allied had such surveillance specialists in place, though he expected the figure to rise in the coming months, and that only high-profile buildings tended to have a uniformed police presence, as at 345 Park. But, he noted, "things are more locked down in New York City than the rest of the country."\n\nThe respondents to the Partnership for New York City survey indicated that they were generally comfortable with their security and unlikely to add to it meaningfully.\n\nBut outside New York, business leaders were beginning to grapple with the possibility that they might need to enhance their security as well. Mr. Ein said Kastle had seen an increase in inquiries this week from buildings outside New York.\n\nMichael Hammer, the chief executive of Dickinson Wright, a law firm with more than 500 lawyers in 23 offices in cities across the United States and Canada, said threats or harassment coming from people connected to a legal matter involving the firm had increased since the pandemic.\n\nMr. Hammer said that the firm typically brought in the police or security to deal with such episodes while also periodically adjusting its protocols, and that it would soon do a general security review. While some of the firm's offices in large cities have a human security presence in their lobbies and require people to have credentials to enter the buildings, that is not true of all its offices.\n\n"In some smaller locations, it is more of an informal situation," Mr. Hammer said. "We'll probably have to investigate it, look at the local tolerance in the office for an armed guard. We'll have to figure it out because it's becoming more prevalent."\n\nDana Rubinstein and Emma Goldberg contributed reporting.\n\nDana Rubinstein and Emma Goldberg contributed reporting.\n\nPHOTO: The office building in New York City where a gunman killed four people on Monday.

13922727631	Trading View	North American Morning Briefing: Tariffs Weigh on Global Stocks; Investors Await Payroll Data	OPENING CALL\n\nStock futures pointed to a lower open Friday after Trump raised tariffs on dozens of countries. Canada is affected as well with a 35% levy which takes effect today.\n\n"Markets were relatively calm as key deals with Japan and the EU were already secured, and talks with China and Mexico continue," IG said .\n\nThat said, t he Canadian dollar fell to a 10-week low against the dollar, and Canada's currency could fall even further given that Mexico secured another pause extension, ING said.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, awaited the results of Exxon Mobil and Chevron and focus turned to nonfarm payrolls data for July. Danske Bank said the data would set the tone in the Treasury market for next week.\n\nThe expected July payroll information was one of several datasets investors are anticipating , and likely to watch closely, to assess Federal Reserve rate-cut chances in September, BNP Paribas said.\n\nThe breadth of job creation will be a key watchpoint as job growth has become more concentrated in understaffed sectors like healthcare. An improvement in the range could provide some reassurance of economic resilience, according to Russell Investments.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nAmazon fell 8.2% after guidance for third-quarter operating income came below analysts' estimates.\n\nApple shares were up 1.9% after reporting higher revenue and iPhone sales up more than 13%.\n\nCoinbase Global fell 11% after second-quarter revenue and third-quarter subscription and services revenue outlook missed expectations.\n\nFirst Solar was up 2.2% after it reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.\n\nMicrosoft gained 0.8% building on gains posted Thursday.\n\nMicroStrategy shares fell 4% after an accounting change allowed it to include an unrealized gain on the company's digital assets.\n\nReddit shares rose 14% after it swung to a second-quarter profit.\n\nTesla was down 1.6% after it began offering ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nWatch For:\n\nU.S. Employment Report for July; U.S. Construction Spending for June; U.S. University of Michigan Final Consumer Survey for July; 2Q earnings from Chevron; Enbridge; ExxonMobil\n\nToday's Top Headlines/Must Reads:\n\n- Millions of Student-Loan Borrowers Prepare for Higher Payments\n\n- Silicon Valley's New Strategy: Move Slow and Build Things\n\n- Why the Latest Meme Stock Craze Won't Take Down the Overall Market\n\nMARKET WRAPS\n\nForex:\n\nThe dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies and should gain further if U.S. jobs data for July is strong, but any rise is likely to be limited, MUFG said.\n\nThe dollar gained renewed momentum and July was the currency's best month since April 2022, Deutsche Bank said . The dollar gained 3.19% against a basket of currencies last month.\n\nThe dollar steadied against other currencies after having risen to a two-month high overnight. The reasons why the U.S. currency weakened throughout most of this year remained and continued to pose a risk, UniCredit said.\n\nThe euro edged higher against the dollar but continued to trade below $1.15 as the trade deal agreed between the U.S. and the European Union weighed on the currency.\n\nThe euro might not fall too much more, UniCredit said, adding the euro selloff likely also reflected investors unwinding some bets in favor of the euro.\n\nBonds:\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose as investors awaited nonfarm payrolls data. Analysts in The Wall Street Journal's poll forecast 100,000 new jobs versus 147,000 in June.\n\n"A slight softening of the labor market, as the consensus expects, would still be in-line with our soft-landing outlook," Russell Investments said.\n\nMetals:\n\nGold futures slipped and were on track to end the week lower on easing safe-haven demand.\n\nThe precious metal has slid in recent days as market turns risk-on, BMI said.\n\nSpot gold was little changed as Comex gold futures were still consolidating RHB Retail Research said.\n\nEnergy:\n\nOil prices were mixed with Brent trading flat while the WTI edged downward. Oil prices rose significantly on week, with Brent and WTI 6% and 6.3% higher, respectively.\n\nTODAY'S TOP HEADLINES\n\nNintendo Gets Profit Boost From Strong Switch 2 Sales\n\nNintendo's net profit jumped in the first quarter, topping market expectations, driven in part by strong sales of its new Switch 2 console.\n\nThe Japanese videogame maker said Friday that net profit rose 19% from a year earlier to 96.03 billion yen, equivalent to $636.9 million, for the three months ended June. That beat the estimate of Yen64.7 billion in a poll of analysts by data provider Visible Alpha.\n\nIAG Operating Profit Beats Consensus on Strong Revenue Growth\n\nBritish Airways owner IAG reported consensus-beating operating profit growth for the second quarter, driven by strong revenue performance.\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group, which also houses Iberia and Vueling among others, on Friday reported a 2.6% rise in passenger revenue per available seat-kilometer to 8.55 euros ($9.76). Visible Alpha consensus for the key industry metric-a measure of the ratio between an airline's revenue and its passenger carrying capacity-was for a rise of 1.9% year-on-year.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Blow Past Estimates as Customers Raced to Beat Tariffs\n\nApple iPhone sales blew past Wall Street's expectations in the June quarter as some U.S. consumers rushed to buy their devices before potential price increases from tariffs.\n\nThe robust sales growth for the company's signature product was the highest increase in years, exceeding 13%, a testament to tariff-related spending habits and the popularity of its latest devices, including a cheaper iPhone released earlier this year.\n\nAmazon Shares Fall Because Cloud Unit's Growth Wasn't Enough for Wall Street\n\nAmazon.com reported sharp increases in sales and profit, partly fueled by the growth of its cloud-computing business.\n\nThe company said Thursday that revenue rose by 13% during the second quarter to $168 billion. Profit increased 35%. The sales and profit results beat Wall Street's expectations.\n\nBig Tech's $400 Billion AI Spending Spree Just Got Wall Street's Blessing\n\nThe AI arms race is accelerating as the major tech companies add to their already gargantuan levels of spending. The bets are paying off for investors, but not for all employees.\n\nAlphabet's Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms are set to spend nearly $400 billion this year on capital expenditures, largely to build their artificial-intelligence infrastructure. That is more than the European Union spent on defense last year.\n\nAsia Manufacturing Outlook Marks Five-Year Low as Tariff Concerns Linger\n\nSentiment among Southeast Asian manufacturers fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, with confidence slipping to a five-year low amid trade policy uncertainty and subdued demand.\n\nThis came as the region's manufacturing sector saw its first rise in output since March. The Asean PMI gauge returned to expansion in July at 50.1, slightly above the neutral mark of 50.0, compared with 48.6 in June.\n\nChina's Manufacturing Activity Tumbles Into Contraction\n\nA private gauge of China's manufacturing activity returned to contractionary territory in July, as softening new business growth led factories to scale back production.\n\nThe S&P Global China general manufacturing purchasing managers index declined to 49.5 in July from 50.4 in June, according to data released Friday by S&P Global. A reading above 50 suggests an expansion in activity, while a reading below suggests contraction.\n\nSouth Korea's Exports Accelerate, Fueled by Chip Demand\n\nSouth Korea's export growth was stronger than expected in July, driven largely by strong demand for high-performance computing chips amid the artificial-intelligence boom.\n\nThe upbeat print-a second straight month of resilient growth-arrived days after a South Korean-U.S. trade deal was reached, reducing concerns that President Trump's tariffs would weigh on the export-reliant economy.\n\nTrump's Vow to Be 'President of Peace' Falls Short in Ukraine and Gaza\n\nSince returning to the White House, President Trump has branded himself as the "president of peace," boasting that he has averted half a dozen wars and repeatedly saying he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Yet six months into his term, his record is decidedly mixed, with scant headway in ending two of the world's most intractable wars, Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nTrump has had his successes. He has leveraged economic pressure to tamp down a border clash between Cambodia and Thailand and, his aides say, engaged in intensive telephone diplomacy to avert a war from spiraling between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed powers.\n\nCongress Looks to Punish China While Trump Pursues Trade Deal\n\nLawmakers in both houses of Congress introduced legislation targeting China on Thursday, a reminder of Capitol Hill's deep-seated desire to punish Beijing over human rights even as President Trump gives priority to a trade deal.\n\nThe bipartisan bills touch on issues that have long vexed American policymakers, namely signs that Beijing tries to stifle Chinese dissent in the U.S. and that, at home, it has abused ethnic minorities including Uyghurs.\n\nThe Rough Day in Court for Trump's Tariffs\n\nWASHINGTON-President Trump's assertion of emergency powers to impose worldwide tariffs faced its toughest legal test yet on Thursday, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit voiced skepticism of his unilateral move to impose levies that are normally Congress's responsibility.\n\nThe oral argument touched on key questions in the dispute: Do chronic problems like the trade imbalance and cross-border drug smuggling qualify as emergencies allowing the president to set aside normal laws? Do federal courts have the power to review the president's emergency determinations? And does the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the 1977 law known as Ieepa that Trump invoked, allow the president to impose tariffs at all?\n\nSalvadoran Legislators Clear Way for Bukele's Unlimited Re-Election\n\nEl Salvador's ruling-party legislators pushed through constitutional changes eliminating presidential term limits and allowing President Nayib Bukele, who is serving his second term, to run an unlimited number of times.\n\nThe legislation, introduced and voted on without debate at committee levels on Thursday, will allow Bukele, who has served as president since 2019, to further consolidate the almost total power he already holds in the impoverished Central American country of some six million people, opponents and analysts said.\n\nU.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff to Visit Gaza as Trump, Under Pressure, Seeks Aid Plan\n\nWASHINGTON-U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit the Gaza Strip on Friday to develop a new aid-distribution plan, the White House said Thursday, part of the Trump administration's push to alleviate the deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nWitkoff, who will be accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, intends to brief President Trump shortly after the mission to the enclave. What Witkoff sees will inform a new strategy to feed a territory suffering from famine-like conditions, according to humanitarian groups and monitors.\n\nWrite to pierre.bertrand@wsj.com\n\nTODAY IN CANADA\n\n2Q Earnings:\n\nAltaGas\n\nBrookfield Renewable\n\nEnbridge Inc\n\nFortis Inc\n\nImperial Oil\n\nMagna International\n\nTelus Corp\n\nTransAlta Corporation\n\nEconomic Indicators (ET):\n\n0930 Canada Manufacturing PMI data for July\n\nStocks to Watch:\n\nArc Resources 2Q EPS C$0.68; 2Q Net C$396.1M; 2Q Avg Production 357,228 BOE/Day; 2Q Funds From Operations C$682M, or C$1.17/Share; Boosts 2025 Capital Spending Plan to C$1.85B-C$1.95B; Sees 2025 Production 385,000-395,000 BOE/Day\n\nAkita Drilling 2Q Rev C$49.6M; 2Q EPS C$0.06\n\nCrombie REIT: Sarah MacDonald and Kyle Hartlen to Join Crombie's Bd of Trustees\n\nDefinity Financial 2Q EPS C$0.84\n\nMEG Energy Raises Quarterly Dividend to C$0.11 From C$0.10; 2Q Adjusted Funds Flow C$125M, or C$0.49/Share; 2Q Production 63,502 Barrels/Day; 2025 Operating, Capital Guidance Unchanged\n\nFairfax Financial 2Q EPS $61.61\n\nFairfax India Holdings 2Q EPS $2.06; Book Value Per Shr $21.43 at June 30\n\nAndlauer Healthcare Group 2Q Net C$13.5M; Andlauer Healthcare Group 2Q Rev C$156.6M\n\nEro Copper 2Q EPS 68c; Ero Copper 2Q Rev $163.5M\n\nCanfor Corp 2Q Loss/Shr C$1.71; 2Q Adj Loss/Shr C$0.56; 2Q Loss C$202.8M; 2Q Sales C$1.38B\n\nCanfor Pulp Products 2Q Loss/Shr C$0.10; 2Q Loss C$6.7M; 2Q Sales C$177.9M\n\nRF Capital Group 2Q Vs.

13909984490	KFF Health News	First Edition: Friday, Aug. 1, 2025	Today's early morning highlights from the major news organizations. KFF HEALTH NEWS ORIGINAL STORIES\n\n KFF Health News: Deep Staff Cuts At A Little-Known Federal Agency Pose Trouble For Droves Of Local Health Programs\n\n A little-known federal agency that sends more than $12 billion annually to support community health centers, addiction treatment services, and workforce initiatives for America's neediest people has been hobbled by the Trump administration's staffing purges. The cuts are "just a little astonishing," said Carole Johnson, who previously led the Health Resources and Services Administration. She left the agency in January with the administration change and has described the sweeping staff cuts as a "big threat" to the agency's ability to distribute billions of dollars in grants to hospitals, clinics, nonprofits, and other organizations nationwide. (Tribble and Larweh, 8/1)\n\n KFF Health News: This Test Can See A Heart Attack In Your Future\n\n A long list of Lynda Hollander's paternal relatives had heart disease, and several had undergone major surgeries. So when she hit her mid-50s and saw her cholesterol levels creeping up after menopause, she said, "I didn't want to take a chance." A cardiologist told Hollander that based on factors like age, sex, cholesterol, and blood pressure, she faced a moderate risk of a major cardiac event, like a heart attack, within the next 10 years. (Span, 8/1)\n\n KFF Health News: KFF Health News' 'What The Health?': Next On Kennedy's List? Preventive Care And Vaccine Harm\n\n In his ongoing effort to reshape health policy, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly plans to overhaul two more government entities: the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Ousting the existing members of the task force would give Kennedy a measure of control in determining the kinds of preventive care that are covered at no cost to patients in the United States. (Rovner, 7/31)\n\n PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS\n\n The Hill: Trump Demands Pharma Companies Slash Drug Prices In Next 60 Days\n\n President Trump sent letters Thursday to 17 of the world's largest drug companies, telling them to take more steps to slash the prices of prescription drugs to match the lowest price in certain foreign countries. The letters represent an escalation of the administration's push for lower drug prices by launching a "most favored nation" model, which ties the prices of prescription medicines in the U.S. to the lowest found among comparably wealthy nations. (Weixel, 7/31)\n\n Modern Healthcare: HRSA To Launch Voluntary 340B Drug Rebate Pilot Program In 2026\n\n The federal government has cracked open the door to what could be a transformation of the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Health Resources and Services Administration is launching a voluntary program to test drugmakers paying rebates after purchase to safety-net providers that participate in 340B rather than discounting prices upfront, the agency announced Thursday. (Early, 7/31)\n\n VACCINE POLICY AND COVID\n\n Bloomberg: CDC Cuts Experts Out Of Panels That Develop Vaccine Policy\n\n The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told physician groups, public health professionals and infectious disease experts that they will no longer be invited to help review vaccine data and develop recommendations, according to an email viewed by Bloomberg. The move marks an escalation in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to assert control over the CDC's vaccine advisory process. (Cohrs Zhang and Nix, 8/1)\n\n CBS News: Former Vaccine Panel Ousted By RFK Jr. Says Scientific Rigor Is "Rapidly Eroding"\n\n All 17 experts who were ousted from a government panel on vaccine recommendations last month are speaking out against what the panel has become under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. In a commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, titled "The Path Forward for Vaccine Policy in the United States," the former members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices described a "seismic disruption" to the vaccine recommendation process in the U.S. (Moniuszko, 7/31)\n\n The New York Times: CDC Says Childhood Vaccination Rates Have Dropped Again\n\n New federal data shows that vaccination rates among American children entering kindergarten fell during the 2024-25 school year, extending a worrying trend that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. The percentage of children granted exemptions from vaccines has also risen sharply over the past decade. The statistics, released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provide a sobering explanation for the resurgence of childhood diseases across the United States. (Mandavilli, Rosenbluth and Paris, 7/31)\n\n The Hill: FDA's Marty Makary Again Floats COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory\n\n Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Marty Makary again promoted a conspiracy theory about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Wednesday of funding the lab that created the virus. Makary, when asked by NewsNation's Connell McShane about the longevity of the Trump administration's changes to federal health agencies such as the FDA, blasted the previous NIH leadership while floating the theory. (O'Connell-Domenech, 7/31)\n\n Bloomberg: Moderna To Cut 10% Of Staff To Offset Slowing Covid Business\n\n Moderna Inc. is cutting about 10% of its workforce, part of an effort by the struggling biotech company to reduce spending as sales of its Covid vaccine decline. In a note to employees, Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said the company was "aligning our cost structure to the realities of our business." (Smith, 7/31)\n\n MedPage Today: COVID's Gut Punch: Some GI Disorders Rose Post-Pandemic\n\n Disorders of gut-brain interaction -- such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- rose significantly in both the U.S. and the U.K. following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a population-based survey study. Surveys revealed that the proportion of adults meeting criteria for at least one such disorder increased from 38.3% in 2017 to 42.6% in 2023 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.31), Imran Aziz, MD, of the University of Sheffield in England, and colleagues reported in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. (McCreary, 7/31)\n\n FUNDING AND RESEARCH CUTS\n\n Los Angeles Times: Trump Freezes $200 Million In UCLA Science, Medical Research Funding, Citing Antisemitism Allegations\n\n The Trump administration has frozen hundreds of science, medical and other federal grants to UCLA worth nearly $200 million, citing the university's alleged "discrimination" in admissions and failure to "promote a research environment free of antisemitism." The decision to pull funding comes after Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and the Justice Department said this week that UCLA would pay a "heavy price" for acting with "deliberate indifference" to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, Israel's ensuing war in Gaza and campus protests the events spurred last year. (Kaleem, 7/31)\n\n Stat: Jay Bhattacharya Moves From Disparity Researcher To DEI Enforcer\n\n The April announcement of National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya's appointment and his public profile at Stanford University, where he was a professor of health policy, both state that his work has focused on vulnerable populations, and he's published at least five papers on racial health disparities. In June, he specifically lauded sickle cell research as an NIH success, highlighting it as the kind of work "that advances the health and well-being of minority populations," and that the NIH should continue supporting. "It absolutely must," he told podcaster Andrew Huberman. (Oza, McFarling and Boodman, 8/1)\n\n The War Horse: List Of Positions At VA That Took Deferred Resignations\n\n It's been six months since a now-infamous email presented millions of federal workers with a pivotal decision: They could reply "resign" to give up their job and receive full pay and benefits through the end of September. Or they could stay in their positions and hope they didn't get laid off in the ensuing chaotic months of the second Trump administration. Perhaps no agency was impacted more than the Department of Veterans Affairs, which runs by far the largest federal payroll outside of the military, with more than 467,000 employees providing health care and benefits to 9.1 million veterans. (Rosenbaum, 7/31)\n\n MORE ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\n\n MedPage Today: FDA Slaps Stronger Warnings On Opioids\n\n Opioid medications will be required to have their labeling updated to highlight the safety risks of long-term use, the FDA announced on Thursday. The agency is requiring opioid manufacturers to add to the prescribing information that higher doses are associated with increased risk of serious harm, and that the risks of serious harms persist over the course of therapy, among other changes. (Lou, 7/31)\n\n NBC News: Trump Revives Presidential Fitness Test\n\n The Presidential Fitness Test is coming back. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday afternoon reinstating the national fitness assessment implemented in public schools from 1956 until 2013. The role of administering the test will fall to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been vocal in his concern about childhood obesity and whose "Make America Healthy Again" report in February attributed the issue, in part, to sedentary lifestyles.

13909984475	Fortune	10 finance companies that made the biggest leaps on the 2025 Fortune Global 500 list	Good morning. Companies earning a spot on the 2025 Fortune Global 500 demonstrated significant momentum this year-including those in the financial sector.\n\n The corporations on this year's list, released this week, combined to generate $41.7 trillion in revenue in 2024, up 1.8% from the previous year. Together, they employ 70.1 million people, and their revenue represents more than one-third of the world's GDP.\n\n For the 12th consecutive year-and the 20th time since 1995- Walmart is No. 1 on the list. The ranking showed a dominant presence of U.S. companies (138). The U.S. remains ahead of Greater China, which has 130 companies (down three from last year). You can view the complete list here\n\n Overall, the Global 500 earned $2.98 trillion in profit in its second-most-profitable year ever-and $1 trillion of that was generated by finance companies.

To deliver even stronger performance, we are evolving our strategy, improving execution, and building a high-performing culture."\n\n Dermot McDonogh, CFO of BNY No. 389 , up 77 spots): "We're hitting our stride in BNY's transformation and firing on all cylinders. We've built a more connected, agile organization-one that's breaking down silos and working more closely with clients than ever before. As a company that sits at the center of the global financial system, we have a unique opportunity to help our clients navigate change, unlock opportunity, and operate with greater confidence.\n\n "Our investments in talent, culture, and technology like AI are making us sharper, faster, and more resilient.

Many of the new "reciprocal" rates for other countries, however, will come into effect on Aug. 7, providing U.S. Customs time to implement the changes.

13916203878	Bloomberg	NYC's Horrific Shooting Is Deeply Personal for Police Boss Jessica Tisch	(Bloomberg) -- It was just after 1:30 a.m., and Jessica Tisch was walking the eerie quiet of 345 Park Avenue, surveying the detritus of a deadly attack.\n\nAs the scrunch of broken glass cut the silence and blood still glistened on the floor, a distraught Tisch confronted her most challenging moment yet as New York City's police commissioner. Mere hours earlier, a lone gunman with an assault rifle stalked this very space, ending the life of four people before taking his own. \n\nTisch's critical role had already placed her at the nexus of business, law enforcement and politics. Now, the city's worst mass shooting in 25 years intersected with her deep ties to the New York establishment, thrusting a deeply personal moment into the open.\n\nStrands of fate connected Tisch, 44, to the victims of Monday evening's rampage. Didarul Islam, killed in the lobby, was an officer in the police force she leads. Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, shot after trying to take cover behind a column, was her personal friend.\n\nThe setting itself held weight for Tisch. The 44-story tower is owned by Rudin Management, run by a 100-year-old property dynasty that has been closely linked with Tisch's billionaire real estate family for generations. Julia Hyman, an associate at Rudin, was killed on the 33rd floor by the gunman, after he shot building security guard Aland Etienne.\n\n"Aland, Julia, my beautiful friend Wesley, and police officer Didarul Islam - they were taken from our arms in violence," an emotional Tisch said at a vigil this week.\n\nThe shooter had intended to target the offices of the National Football League, an employee of which was seriously injured. The NFL's New York Giants team is owned by another member of the Tisch family.\n\nCommissioner Tisch has previously touted dropping crime rates in New York City, and has presided over a 6% reduction in major crimes during the first half of the year. Her steady hand in the top job - she was appointed in November last year - has already made her a flashpoint in the ongoing mayoral race as business leaders seek assurances she will retain her role even in a new administration. \n\n"Given her family dynamic, there were people in city government who didn't know her and frankly didn't expect much before working with her," said Eric Phillips, a friend of the commissioner and an aide to former Mayor Bill de Blasio. "Her name may have opened some doors, but she's the real deal, and even her critics privately admit that."\n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor and a vocal critic of the police force in the past, has more recently struck a conciliatory tone. He lauded the response to the attack and even reached out to have a conversation with Tisch after the shooting, according to a spokesperson.\n\nWith the city on edge, Tisch is the right person for the job, according to Amanda Hindlian, who has held senior roles at Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange - two of the city's most prominent symbols of commerce.\n\n"New Yorkers still have to contend with violence, whether in an office building or a CEO walking outside of a hotel in Midtown Manhattan," Hindlian said. "She has the trust of the business community."\n\nFor Hindlian, it's critical that Tisch stay on the job as police commissioner as a "check and balance" to a potential Mayor Mamdani, who has set out a flurry of proposals - ranging from tax hikes to rent freezes - that have dismayed the city's moneyed class. \n\nIndeed, if it were up to Wall Street and the business community, the real estate heiress would be the next New York City mayor.\n\n"There are a lot of people who feel like, if given a choice we'll all vote for her as a mayor," said Tom Glocer, the former head of Thomson Reuters and a visible figure in the city's business circles.\n\n"Since she's from a prominent family, she's not counting on a public office salary for her next meal," he said. "It breeds a sense that she's in it for public service."\n\nTisch declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nTisch's tenure as NYPD Commissioner - the fourth person in that role under Mayor Eric Adams - has largely been seen as a bright spot within the current administration, after the previous two police commissioners were enmeshed in scandal.\n\nGeorge Walker, who runs the $538 billion money manager Neuberger Berman from its headquarters just blocks away from the shooting, says his workforce's No. 1 concern is safety.\n\n"Commissioner Tisch has been extremely impressive and has engendered great confidence," Walker said. "The next mayor - whomever it is - would be wise to retain her."\n\nFormer Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after being vanquished in the Democratic primary, as well as Mamdani have said they would consider keeping Tisch as commissioner.\n\nHarvard to NYPD\n\nThe real estate advocacy group, The Association for a Better New York, got its start in 1971, led by the Rudin family. Its inaugural meeting took place at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, in what came to be known as the original power breakfast. That has given the Tisch family-owned Loews Regency its standing in the city as the convening spot for movers and shakers.\n\nJessica Tisch, however, has so far stayed away from the family business.\n\nWhile Tisch - a puzzles enthusiast - has held other roles within the country's largest police force, she has never been a uniformed police officer. After earning a law degree from Harvard University - where Senator Elizabeth Warren taught one of her classes - she started her career in counterterrorism and later took on a key tech role at the NYPD under de Blasio. \n\nThat stint has been credited with modernizing policing methods at the NYPD to combat crime, even though it alienated some longstanding officers used to the old ways, according to a former colleague.\n\nThat tech instinct didn't translate into all aspects of Tisch's life: She has joked that even well into her adulthood, her grandmother's daily calls used to serve as her morning alarm. \n\nIntensely focused, and typically unflappable, Tisch is also seen as fiercely loyal and protective of her team.\n\nTisch, who decorated her office with gizmos tied to her IT reforms and a bowl of treats for visitors, would often have lunch catered for her team from the landmark 2nd Avenue Deli.\n\n'Rats Don't Run the City'\n\nWhile she has eschewed the limelight, her stint as trash boss was a source of amusement for those around her. \n\nAs sanitation commissioner, Tisch's ultimatums to the rodent residents of the city caught fire on social media as she spearheaded an effort to help NYC rebound from the pandemic.\n\n"Rats are absolutely going to hate this announcement, but the rats don't run the city - we do," she said in one viral missive.\n\nJust a few days after Adams gave her the reins to the police department, Tisch faced her first major test. In early December, UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive Brian Thompson was murdered on his way to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nA manhunt ended with the arrest of Luigi Mangione, and both state and federal prosecutors are now pursuing cases against him. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThompson's killing occurred just a few blocks from Monday evening's shooting at 345 Park Avenue. In the early hours of Tuesday, as she walked through the scene, Tisch was accompanied by Adams and Bill Rudin, the building owner's co-executive chairman.\n\nEvidence markers identified over 20 shell casings still littered across the lobby.\n\nAt the funeral service on Thursday for officer Islam, an immigrant from Bangladesh, Tisch eulogized him for more than 15 minutes.\n\nShe spoke of Islam's bond with his police partner, who is from the Dominican Republic. And in doing so, she evoked a vision of New York City as she saw it.\n\n"Two journeys, two traditions, two lives shaped continents apart, and yet here, in this city," Tisch said.

13916203730	Minnesota Star Tribune	Anderson: Gun suppressors or gun silencers? Either way, the Big Beautiful Bill shoots down a $200 tax	Popular among Minnesotans, suppressors likely will see increased sales with the change.\n\n There's a scene in the movie "John Wick: Chapter 2,'' in which no one else notices the shoot-out between the movie's star, Keanu Reeves, and another dude because their pistols are equipped with "silencers."\n\n Memo to the Writers Guild of America: There are no gun silencers. Only gun suppressors.\n\n Suppressors don't make guns silent when fired.\n\n They do, however, reduce a firearm's "bang'' to a level that leaves a shooter's ear drums intact.\n\n Which for most people who own suppressors - or who wish they did - is the point.\n\n The topic arises because - surprisingly to everyone except the relatively few Americans who are suppressor savvy - President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, which is now law, removes the $200 federal tax stamp that was required to purchase a suppressor.\n\n The change is effective beginning in 2026, and eventually is expected to boost suppressor sales.\n\n Gun opponents aren't happy with the switcheroo.\n\n "Quite frankly, what is in the reconciliation bill does more to support assassins than it does American families," U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, was quoted as saying.\n\n To put such hyperbole in context, let's look at some facts:\n\n •Minnesota is among 42 states where suppressors can be legally purchased. But buying a suppressor is considerably more cumbersome than purchasing a hunting rifle or shotgun. It's a virtual certainty that no John Wick-type character would submit to the fingerprinting, photo submission and other requirements, including two contacts with a local sheriff. Also, suppressors are stamped with serial numbers and assigned to specific buyers, with records retained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\n • Hunters represent perhaps a third of suppressor purchasers. Primarily, they want to save their hearing. Also, they don't want to scare away game if they miss a shot. And they don't want to disturb other game in the area (where their buddies might be hunting).\n\n • Most of the remaining 60% or so of suppressor purchasers are target shooters or enthusiasts who plink at ranges for fun or in competition. In addition to quieting a gun, suppressors reduce recoil, making shooting more comfortable without affecting accuracy.\n\n • Suppressors aren't cheap. Most are made of titanium and/or stainless steel, which are durable and lightweight. Depending on the firearm caliber to be fitted, buyers can spend about $500 to about $1,200 for most suppressors. In some cases, suppressors can fit multiple guns. In other cases, they are gun (or at least caliber) specific. Older gun barrels sometimes have to be threaded so suppressors can be attached. Many new firearms come threaded from the factory, and some are offered in short versions so they aren't overlong if suppressors are attached.\n\n • Suppressors, unfortunately, like some guns, can be made by knowledgeable people using 3D printers. Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City in December 2024, was reported to have used a partially 3D-printed Glock-like 9mm semi-automatic pistol fitted with a 3D-printed suppressor.\n\n Interesting as those facts are, this one is even more so:\n\n The founder of the nation's largest suppressor manufacturer and retailer isn't now, nor has he ever been what is commonly referred to as a gun nut.\n\n Nor is he a ballistician or an engineer of any type.\n\n He's a pharmacist from Sioux Falls, S.D.\n\n "Some years ago I became interested in shooting prairie dogs, and to do it I'd drive four or five hours west of Sioux Falls,'' said Brandon Maddox, 53, founder and CEO of Silencer Central (OK, movies aren't the only ones that misname suppressors) headquartered in Sioux Falls, S.D. "I found out rather quickly that after you shoot a few times, the other prairie dogs are frightened by the sound and go in their holes and don't come back out. That was a long way to drive to learn that, so I purchased a suppressor.''\n\n Fast forward 20 years, and Maddox's company is doing about $120 million in annual sales.\n\n "We're actually two companies in one, we're a manufacturer of suppressors and we're also a licensed dealer in the 42 states where suppressors are legal,'' he said. "I started the company because I thought I could improve the process of buying a suppressor.''\n\n As it has for the last 10 years or so, Silencer Central will have a booth at Game Fair when it opens Friday, Aug. 8, in Ramsey for two three-day weekends. Anyone who wants to buy a suppressor at the booth can have their fingerprints and photos taken on site and the proper government forms filled out and sent to ATF electronically.\n\n "A copy of the paperwork is also sent to the purchaser's local sheriff,'' Maddox said. "The sheriff will also be notified a second time after we receive final approval from the ATF. Then we ship the suppressor to the buyer.''\n\n Kory Krause, owner of Frontiersman Sports in St. Louis Park, has a kiosk in his store designed to make suppressor purchases as straight-forward as possible.\n\n "The kiosk allows the purchaser to enter all of his or her personal information, and for fingerprints and photographs to be taken right there,'' Krause said. "There's a small charge to use it unless you buy specific models of suppressors. Then it's free.''\n\n Suppressor ownership comes with federal and sometimes state rules, Krause stressed, and hunters need to be particularly aware of regulations in states where suppressors are illegal.\n\n Some gun advocates had hoped the Big Beautiful Bill would have made buying a suppressor similar to purchasing a hunting shotgun or rifle, which in most cases can be done in almost real time by people without arrest records.\n\n Their argument is that suppressors are essentially guns by another name and that restrictions governing them should be limited by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions regarding gun ownership.\n\n Perhaps the Supreme Court will someday rule specifically on suppressors. Until it does, some states will continue to ban them. And purchasing suppressors will require detailed information submitted to federal and local authorities.\n\n "Minnesota is a big state for Silencer Central in terms of the number of suppressors we sell there,'' Maddox said. "It's not Texas, which is number one in sales in part because they allow night hunting for wild hogs. But Minnesota is pretty good.''\n\n	IRRELEVANT
13916203842	STAT News	In health insurers' race to offload unprofitable members, winners begin to emerge	If you've followed health insurance earnings over the past few weeks, you might be experiencing some whiplash.\n\n Four of the biggest players - top names like UnitedHealth Group and Elevance - lowered their profit expectations for the year, while two others - Humana and CVS Health - raised them. One, Cigna, reaffirmed its previous outlook.\n\n It turns out, the returns health insurers saw in the first half of 2025 were largely determined by what they did in the previous two years. Some saw the writing on the wall early and shook off unprofitable plans in specific counties, emerging with more stable, albeit slimmer, profiles. Others weren't as proactive, and they're now paying the price.\n\n	RELEVANT
13916203742	Business Insider	Dow Jones Index Today: DJIA Slumps on Weak Jobs Report and Negative Consumer Sentiment	The Dow Jones is down by over 1% following a disappointing nonfarm payrolls report and continued weakness in consumer sentiment.\n\n Elevate Your Investing Strategy:\n\n Take advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\n\n July's nonfarm payrolls increased by 73,000, well below the consensus estimate for 104,000. The pressure intensified after the Bureau of Labor Statistics slashed June's job gain to 14,000, down by 133,000, and cut May's figure by 125,000 to 19,000.\n\n The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose for a second consecutive month to 61.7 in July. At the same time, the figure fell short of the estimate for 62.0.\n\n "Although recent trends show sentiment moving in a favorable direction, sentiment remains broadly negative," said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu. On the bright side, year-ahead inflation expectations declined for a second straight month to 4.5% compared to 5.0% in June. Long-term inflation expectations fell to 3.4% in July from 4.0% in June.\n\n The market is also reeling from new tariff rates. On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging between 10% and 41% on dozens of countries. Switzerland was among the worst hit with a rate of 39%, while Japan and India received rates of 15% and 25%, respectively.\n\n The Dow Jones is down by 1.44% at the time of writing.\n\n Which Stocks are Moving the Dow Jones?\n\n Let's pivot to TipRanks' Dow Jones Heatmap , which illustrates the stocks that have contributed to the index's price action.\n\n Every single tech stock in the Dow Jones is trading lower as the sector takes a breather from several strong weeks of performance. Furthermore, Amazon is deep in the red despite the e-commerce leader reporting a double beat on earnings and adjusted EPS. It appears that investors were underwhelmed with the company's cloud growth and profit guidance.\n\n Elsewhere, all four industrials stocks are trading lower, while UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is continuing to fall in the wake of the embattled healthcare company announcing a new CFO.\n\n DIA Stock Moves Lower with the Dow Jones\n\n The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is an exchange-traded fund designed to track the movement of the Dow Jones. As a result, DIA is falling alongside the Dow Jones today.\n\n Wall Street believes that DIA stock has room to rise. During the past three months, analysts have issued an average DIA price target of $490.77, implying upside of 12.72% from current prices. The 31 stocks in DIA carry 29 buy ratings, 2 hold ratings, and zero sell ratings.\n\n Disclaimer & Disclosure Report an Issue\n\n SHARE THIS POST\n\n	IRRELEVANT
13916203751	Bloomberg	Blackstone Tells Employees They Can Return to NYC Office Aug. 4	(Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Inc. is reopening its New York headquarters on Monday after keeping the office shuttered in the wake of a shooting spree that killed four people, including one of its senior executives.\n\nThe firm's offices at 345 Park Ave. will be open to any employees who wish to return, Blackstone said Friday in an internal memo. The world's biggest alternative asset manager also gave staff the option to work remotely for the entire week. \n\nA spokesperson for Blackstone confirmed the contents of the memo.\n\nBlackstone real estate executive Wesley LePatner was among those who were killed on July 28, when a gunman opened fire in the skyscraper's lobby in New York City's worst mass shooting in a quarter century. \n\nThe firm's leaders, President Jon Gray and Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman, now are trying to help employees process their trauma and loss. \n\nBlackstone, a major commercial property owner, has long been a proponent of having employees in the office five days a week and was among the first to summon them back during the pandemic.\n\nThe company has told staff who work at headquarters that it plans to resume a normal schedule on Aug. 11, while accommodating those who aren't comfortable returning by then. Blackstone also reiterated that counseling is available to those who want it.\n\nThe 44-story tower in Midtown Manhattan is also home to KPMG, landlord Rudin Management and the National Football League. This week's rampage stands to change security in that iconic tower and the rest of Wall Street. \n\nBlackstone also told employees that it has been working with Rudin, the New York Police Department and outside contractors to enhance security measures.\n\nRudin had already bolstered security in recent years in response to crime in the area and the December murder of UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive Brian Thompson.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n	RELEVANT
13916203795	Minnesota Star Tribune	Culture shift at UnitedHealth? Minnesota hospitals are wary	Hemsley began his comments Tuesday by thanking workers and describing the tone he wants the company to set.\n\nBuilding trust is not simply a worthy goal, one former company executive said this week. It's also imperative if UnitedHealth Group wants to avoid the government it breaking into parts like past corporate behemoths Bell Telephone and Standard Oil.\n\n"Stephen Hemsley, given his stature and history with the company, is the only person who could lead this kind of change," the former executive told the Star Tribune. "Focusing narrowly on quarterly profits, financial engineering, growth at all costs, aggressive denials and gaming government payments for Medicare Advantage is no longer a winning strategy."\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last year that the Justice Department had opened an antitrust investigation into the sprawling company. The revelation of the criminal probe came earlier this year.\n\nMinnesota health care providers are watching because UnitedHealthcare has grown from having no Medicare Advantage enrollment in the state during 2018 to the third-largest in the local MA market last year. The ranking still holds, even though UnitedHealthcare lost about 8,000 enrollees going into 2025 following contract disputes that ultimately were resolved with Bloomington-based HealthPartners and Duluth-based Essentia Health.\n\n"We hope the company is genuinely interested in a cultural change," the Minnesota Hospital Association said.\n\n	RELEVANT

While the shares are down 89% year-to-date, the stock is still pricing in future Elevidys sales and LGMD2E approval, Citi tells investors in a research note\n\n BofA cuts Sarepta to Underperform on uncertain Elevidys future\n\n BofA downgraded Sarepta to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $10, down from $20, after the company agreed to pause shipments of their DMD gene therapy Elevidys at the request of the FDA. The firm thinks this could impact the Elevidys brand further, limiting uptake, as well seeing a renewed chance of Elevidys being removed from the U.S. market, so it removed Elevidys from its model for now, BofA tells investors.\n\n Sarepta downgraded to Underperform at Needham\n\n Needham downgraded Sarepta to Underperform from Hold without a price target. The company late Friday reported receiving an informal request from the FDA to voluntarily halt shipments of Elevidys and that it denied this request, the firm tells investors in a research note. Needham believes this "showdown" between the FDA and Sarepta will likely result with the FDA taking formal action against Elevidys marketing. The firm is now concerned that Elevidys will likely be pulled off the market, creating challenges for Sarepta to meet its 2027 debt obligations of $1.15B.\n\n 5.

13919667901	Minnesota Star Tribune	New CFO at UHG amid big struggles	UnitedHealth Group is bringing in an outsider as its new chief financial officer following months of unprecedented financial challenges at the nation's largest health care company.\n\nWayne DeVeydt, 55, served from 2022 until recently as a managing director of the portfolio group at Bain Capital, a prominent private equity firm based in Boston.\n\nPreviously, he was the longtime CFO at Indiana-based Elevance, the health insurance giant formerly known as Anthem. The company runs for-profit health insurance businesses across the country that use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brands.\n\nDeVeydt becomes CFO at Eden Prairie-based UnitedHealth effective Sept. 2.\n\nHe will take over for John Rex, who has served as CFO at UnitedHealth since 2016. Rex will become a strategic adviser to chief executive Stephen Hemsley.\n\n"Wayne DeVeydt combines deep financial acumen and operational experience with the mission-oriented and compassionate approach to health care that is a perfect fit for UnitedHealth Group," Hemsley said in a statement.\n\nThe company's massive UnitedHealthcare health insurance business announced Tuesday it would drop Medicare Advantage health plans, covering more than 600,000 people as one of several strategies to shore up finances. The company also disclosed this week just how badly it underpriced its health insurance products for 2025.\n\n"Our current view for 2025 reflects $6.5 billion more in medical costs than we anticipated in our initial outlook," UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel told investors Tuesday.\n\nIn Medicare Advantage, where UnitedHealthcare is the nation's largest provider with\n\nnearly 8.5 million enrollees, the company significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not sufficiently modify benefits or plan offerings, Noel said.\n\nThe problem was compounded, he said, because rival companies in Medicare Advantage, a privatized version of the government benefits program, exited from a number of local market across the country.\n\nDeVeydt served as a partner with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers with a focus on the health care sector before joining Anthem in 2005. He served as the CFO at Anthem from 2007 to 2016.\n\nHe spent the next three years as chair and CEO of Surgery Partners Inc., a Nashville-based surgical services firm.\n\n"I've been very fortunate to know John Rex for over two decades and am honored to follow a leader of his caliber," DeVeydt said in a statement.\n\nRex, 63, joined UnitedHealth Group in 2012 as CFO of its Optum health services business, which was newly established at the time. It's become a fast-growing part of the company by running medical clinics, managing pharmacy benefits and selling IT consulting services.\n\n"This pivotal moment for UnitedHealth Group is the right time for a new yet greatly experienced executive like Wayne DeVeydt," Rex said in a statement.\n\nThe new CFO will earn a base salary of $1 million plus a $1.2 million sign-on bonus. He'll also participate in incentive compensation plans with an initial target annual bonus of $2 million.\n\nDeVeydt is receiving stock-based compensation with an estimated value of $18 million, according to a Thursday disclosure with regulators.\n\nPatrick Kennedy of the Minnesota Star Tribune contributed to this story.\n\ncsnowbeck@startribune.com\n\n	RELEVANT
13919667889	Minnesota Star Tribune	EEOC files lawsuit against Mayo Clinic // Ex-employee alleges vaccine requirement violated his rights.	Mayo Clinic discriminated against a security guard by effectively forcing him to get a COVID-19 shot despite his religious beliefs, federal employment regulators claim in a lawsuit against the health care provider.\n\nCiting his Pentecostal faith, Cody Schultz asked Mayo in 2021 to exempt him from its mandatory COVID vaccination policy, according to the suit filed Wednesday by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\nMayo rejected his exemption request and threatened to fire him if he didn't get the shot, according to the suit.\n\nThe Rochester-based health care provider compelled Schultz to get the vaccine or lose his job, violating his "religious observance" and breaking federal law, the suit claims. Schultz worked at Mayo's "site" in Rochester, the complaint says.\n\nMayo Clinic declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nCOVID vaccination mandates have led to an increase in religious discrimination suits by the EEOC in recent years, including one against a subsidiary of Minnesota health care giant UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAll manner of employers, but particularly health care providers, rolled out vaccine mandates as the pandemic raged, aiming to protect employees, customers and patients.\n\nThe EEOC issued guidelines in 2021 saying employers could require vaccinations, but employees could also petition for medical or civil rights - e.g., religious - exemptions.\n\nMayo implemented a mandatory COVID vaccination policy for all employees in December 2021, which applied unless the employee received a medical or religious exemption.\n\nSchultz asked for a religious exemption, telling Mayo he belonged to the Assemblies of God Church, which emphasizes the Pentecostal doctrine of "divine healing," the suit said.\n\nSchultz said he believes that his body "is the Temple of the Holy Spirit" and the vaccine contained certain ingredients that were inconsistent with his religious beliefs. He cited several Bible passages to support his position.\n\nMayo responded that Schultz didn't meet the criteria for a religious exemption. The clinic rejected the security guard's reconsideration request and told him he would lose his job without the shot.\n\nSchultz filed a complaint against Mayo with state human rights regulators and the EEOC.\n\nIn April, the EEOC notified Mayo it had found "reasonable cause" that the clinic had violated federal civil rights law. Conciliation efforts failed, the EEOC claimed.\n\nThe EEOC is asking for a federal court order prohibiting Mayo from "denying reasonable accommodations to employees with sincerely held religious beliefs." The commission is also asking that Schultz be compensated for monetary and non-monetary losses - and awarded punitive damages.\n\nEEOC suits over religious rights and COVID vaccines increased particularly after a U.S. Supreme Court decision in mid-2023 that reinterpreted the 1964 Civil Rights Act's standard for religious accommodation in the workplace.\n\nThat case, Groff v. DeJoy, involved a postal worker's request to be exempted from working on Sundays due to his religious beliefs. The Postal Service declined the exemption, pleading an "undue hardship" - a shortage of carriers.\n\nThe high court unanimously sided with the mail carrier. The decision set a higher bar for employers to show undue hardship in accommodating workers' religious beliefs.\n\nShortly after the decision, the EEOC sued a nationwide furniture dealer, Hank's Furniture, and United Healthcare Services, an arm of Eden Prairie-based UnitedHealth Group, for religious discrimination.\n\nBoth cases centered on denials of exemptions for COVID vaccine mandates.\n\nHank's Furniture settled with the EEOC in July 2024, agreeing to pay $110,000 and adopt a new religious accommodation policy for workers.\n\nThe UnitedHealth case is still pending in an Ohio federal court. It involves a supervisor of clinical administration, Amanda Stone, who worked full-time from home, according to the EEOC. UnitedHealth denies she worked only from home.\n\nIn October 2021, the company began requiring several categories of employees to be vaccinated. Stone asked for an exemption to accommodate her Christian beliefs, using Bible passages to support her argument.\n\nUnitedHealth denied the request, Stone still didn't get the vaccination, and the company fired her. It denies the EEOC's claims.\n\nAs in the Mayo suit, the EEOC is asking for punitive damages from the UnitedHealth subsidiary.\n\nmike.hughlett@startribune.com	RELEVANT
